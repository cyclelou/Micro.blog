				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"uploads/2025/49-2.webp\" alt=\"Schoolkids\" /></p>\n<p>Most of my working life has been spent working in education, mostly for a K-12 school system in a large, mostly rural county but also for a small, private university. The goal of both organizations was conveying knowledge to build an educated citizenry. There's a certain amount of bureaucracy involved and by their very nature, bureaucracies sometimes lose sight of their intended purpose in their struggle to be self-perpetuating. Mostly, though, the people I've worked with have put the focus on doing what it takes to help students learn.</p>\n<p>School systems more moving parts than you might imagine. The biggest group of employees is the faculty, the people who have to get up in front of the students and teach them. I've known so many good teachers. The one characteristic they all shared was a palpable sense of excitement when they were preparing to teach a lesson they thought their students would get into. A lot of thought goes into lesson planning. People usually teach subjects they enjoy. When they think they have a good strategy to really get their point across, they act like athletes before a big game. I always tried to be patient and listen to them share when I could tell they were fired up.</p>\n<p>There are support staff in multiple categories required to operate a school system. When I went to work at my first school, my county was in the process of connecting to the Internet, so I got to usher man, many people into the information age in my IT role. I always made a point to get in tight with several workers at each school: the school secretary because they know everything, the lunch ladies because if you take care of them, they will take care of you and finally, the custodians, because I always needed their help a lot more than they needed mine. There are also other areas to support at the county level, like the huge maintenance department, a bus garage, HR and finance and all the administrators. There were many specialized systems I had to master for those different departments.</p>\n<p>The school based professional staff also had various requirements. I worked with physical and occupational therapists to set up computers for students with special needs, including blind students, students in wheelchairs and other impairments. I helped the medical and mental health folks with securing sensitive information and configuring software for testing and medical devices. During the tension - filled weeks of high-stakes online testing, I had to be on standby in case any network issues affected connectivity.</p>\n<p>Certain departments had the needs for software that pertained just to their roles. There are music programs for the band director and scoring programs for the coaches. We even had an AS-400, an IBM computer that contained all the district's financial data.</p>\n<p>While my job in public school didn't often involve interacting with the students, my higher ed job did. As much as the \"get off my lawn\" types like to grouse about how horrible young people are these days, that has not been my experience. I've found that most students are polite, good listeners, and they just want to be able to use the tech they need to complete their assignments. Sure, some of the more inquisitive ones have tried mightily, and occasionally succeeded in getting around security safeguards, but then so have I, right?</p>\n<p>I like knowing that a good chuck of my life has been in the service of helping people learn. I've done IT work in the medical field, banking and manufacturing too, and none of it was as rewarding as helping teachers and students. After spending the first decade of my adult life in the infantry and as a prison guard, being the helpful computer guy brought me a lot more joy. It really does take a village to produce well-rounded and educated citizens. I was glad to be a part of a good one.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"uploads/2025/livingoutloud-1719616204.png\" alt=\"greensboro-massacre-new\" /></p>\n<p>I'm sharing tonight a repost of a piece I originally wrote last summer about the very real attack by the KKK and Nazis on leftist labor organizers in Greensboro, NC, resulting in five deaths and 10 wounded. Maybe you think that all the recent talk of Fascism and Nazis and white supremacy is a bit overblown. It is not. There are people organizing for change right now who have weathered gunfire and violence from what used to be the extreme right wing. Today, those people are closer to the mainstream.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>In November 1979 I was a junior high student in Jacksonville, NC when I heard on the news about what the media initially called a shootout between the Ku Klux Klan, a group of Neo-Nazis and Communist labor organizers in Greensboro, three hours away. I remember being confused that the Klan and Nazis, who in my mind were relics of a dark but distant past, were still active and engaged in violence. And, I'd never even heard of Communists on American soil. It was a tumultuous time in America that month. It was when Iran took more than 50 Americans hostage. Inflation was over 10% and rising. President Carter was not the revered statesman he is today, but a beleaguered man presiding over a country that felt lost.</p>\n<p>As it turns out, on that day in Greensboro, there was no shootout. Instead, there was a massacre planned with an active police informant that involved carloads of Klansmen and Nazis, who the police knew were on the way to what turned into a killing ground in a public housing project. With television cameras rolling but no law enforcement present, the forefathers of today's alt-right movement gunned down the labor organizers from the Worker's Viewpoint Organization, who were graduates from Duke and Harvard and in a couple of cases, medical doctors. Having previously faced down the Klan at a China Grove, NC rally. The left-wing activists underestimated the willingness of the fascists to engage in violence and paid for it with their lives. Aside from the five who were killed, 10 more were wounded.</p>\n<p>The state and federal government both tried to convict the planners and shooters involved in the massacre. There were numerous eyewitnesses. The Klan was infiltrated with informants. There was ample videotape. In both trials, however, all white juries refused to convict those responsible for the violence and death on the streets of Greensboro. We aren't talking about 1960s Mississippi Burning times. One of these trials happened when Michael Jordan was in college in NC.</p>\n<p>Two decades later, when I became involved in activism in North Carolina, some of the same people who had naively been involved in the Greensboro anti-Klan organizing were still committed to trying to do things like establish a death penalty moratorium, ensure affordable housing, ending the nuclear arms race, ensuring same-sex marriage and stopping the US led war in Iraq. My mentor was a Ph.D. economist from Temple University who had worked for 10 years as a lathe operator in a mill while trying to organize workers. His wife was a leading neurosurgeon who had taken a break from medical school to work on a textile mill to organize the people on the looms. Their lives had been upended by the events of 1979 and Kim, the wife, never quite recovered the fire in her belly to organize, Chip, her husband, remained actively working with low wage workers and community activists until his death in 2014.</p>\n<p>I was horrified when the Unite the Right rally happened in Charlottesville in 2017. I know what these people are capable of doing. They've shown us. Hopefully, those who oppose them won't fall into the same trap as the anti-fascists did in 1979. This stuff isn't from the distant past. It's from the here and now.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2025/32-1.webp\" alt=\"Speak Out\" /></p>\n<p>I have been to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum just once. It was in the 1990s. I took my children to Washington for the express purpose of having them visit. We had to go to the museum in the morning to get tickets to be able to tour it in the afternoon. We spent a little over two hours inside. I've always been interested in history and although I wouldn't say that I studied the holocaust, I'd read many books about World War Two. I knew how Hitler has enacted the <a href='https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/the-nuremberg-race-laws'>Nuremberg Race Laws</a> (modeled on Jim Crow laws from the US). I knew about <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristallnacht'>Kristallnacht</a> , the Night of Broken Glass when the Nazis started a pogrom against Jewish businesses and synagogues in November of 1938. I knew about the death camps like <a href='https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/auschwitz?utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=homepage&amp;utm_campaign=HP0125'>Auschwitz</a>.</p>\n<p>The displays at the museum were haunting and memorable. The one that left the deepest impression was <a href='https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/victims-shoes-speak-volumes-at-us-holocaust-museum/'>a pile of hundreds of leather shoes</a> confiscated from Jews entering one of the camps. Many of the shoes were children's sizes. Most children were killed on the same day they arrived at the camps unless they happened to be twins, in which case their lives would be temporarily spared so Nazi doctors could experiment on them. You could smell the shoes in the exhibit, even from behind glass and even after 50 years of storage. They were a stark reminder of extinguished humanity.</p>\n<p>With the rise of authoritarian government all over the world, including the <a href='https://www.dw.com/en/alternative-for-germany-afd/t-17455253'>far-right AfD</a> in Germany itself, I think it would be good for any American to visit the Holocaust Memorial Museum. See a civilized modern society went mad listening to a popular but insane little man who tooks a country of farmers and industrial workers and turned it into an extermination machine. Think about that the next time you a politician telling you that immigrants are animals and talking about them spoiling the blood of the nation.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.ushmm.org/'>United States Holocaust Memorial Museum</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/en'>Holocaust Encyclopedia</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sonG4lijM5Y'>A visit to the US Holocaust Museum in Washington D.C. - YouTube</a>\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

These inmates were invariably chronic street alcoholics who had contracted tuberculosis and been non-compliant when it came to taking their medication. The state of North Carolina in all of its infinite wisdom decided at some point in the distant past that the best solution to this problem was to make it a crime. They would arrest these men and send them to the prison where I worked where they would receive treatment for TB. When they were no longer contagious, they would be released.</p>\n<p>It was a grim situation, made even grimmer by the conditions of their confinement. The men were housed in a single cell segregation unit, the same type of housing used for prisoners convicted of disciplinary offenses. The health law violators only got to come out of their cells for an hour a day, always wearing a mask. They could mix with each other, but not with anyone else from the population. They were not allowed visitors. Eventually, the law was changed and by the time I left that kind of work in 1993, the Department of Correction had gotten out of the tuberculosis treatment business.</p>\n<p>I don't know if anyone has figured out the logic behind the recently announced cuts to medical research by the fascist government of the United States. Not only are we getting a certified lunatic who admitted that a worm had eaten part of his brain as a cabinet secretary in charge of Health and Human services in Robert Kennedy, Jr., we are apparently just giving up on cancer. Not to worry because the US has also stopped AIDS eradication in Africa and assistance with other worldwide diseases because…I don't know. Fuck all those brown people. Right?</p>\n<p>The tuberculosis comeback should scare people. You see, the prison where I worked in the 80s was originally built to house nothing but prisoners with tuberculosis, not health law violators like I dealt with, but run-of-the-mill bank robbers and cat burglars who just happened to also have TB. There were that many of them. It was only a mile away from a gigantic sanitorium the state operated to treat regular citizens who had the disease.</p>\n<p>I remember a time, also back in the 80s when the US government also didn't give a damn about sick Americans, specifically sick gay Americans during the early days of the AIDS epidemic. St. Ronald Ray-gun couldn't even be bothered to say the name of the illness out loud. That's what we are headed back to now, except the American fascists are uncaring about all the non-billionaires. They plan to let idiots of all stripes forego vaccinations. In the face of a pandemic, no one will have to take any precautions against spreading disease. I know this sounds like the rantings of a crazy person, and two months ago, you would have been right if you thought that. Now, I am right. We are screwed, and eggs are still expensive. <BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

It\nisn&#39;t necessarily difficult to find the commands to download apps, but\nit does require a certain amount of searching around. The free and\nopen-source utility, Applite, provides an App Store like interface for\nHomebrew, allowing you to browse what is available through a GUI.\nAnything you download through Applite can also be updated through the\nsame interface.</p>\n\n<p>When you install Applite, it will offer to install Homebrew . If you\ndon&#39;t have it installed already, you&#39;ll want to do that. Otherwise, just\nchoose the option to use your currently installed version, which will be\ndetected.</p>\n\n<p>Every application in the <a href=\"https://brew.sh/\">Homebrew Catalog</a>\nis available through Applite. When you launch an app downloaded with\nApplite, the built-in Mac security apps, Gatekeeper and Xprotect will\nexamine it to make sure it is safe to run.

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2025/antrim.webp\" alt=\"The_Glens_of_Antrim\" /></p>\n<p>During <a href='https://louplummer.lol/what-happens-when-you-read-too-many-books-on-habits/'>my year-long project</a> to see if it was possible to manufacture happiness, one of the exercises I undertook was to make a list of my own rules to live by](https://louplummer.lol/my-rules-for-me/). One of those rules was <strong>Buy Less Stuff, Go More Places.</strong></p>\n<p>Studies have strongly suggested that memories are more difficult to form when your surroundings don't change. I made the same 30-mile drive to work for twenty years, and the hour and half it took out of my life each day was essentially lost time. I listened to plenty of good books and podcasts in those drives, but the landscape  might as well have been a blank slate. On our recent trip to Florida for the Miami Marathon, every mile was fascinating, even if it was through a typical neighborhood. The architecture and landscaping was so different from what I am used to.</p>\n<p>This is a hard rule to follow when you have disposable income because you're old and have paid off your bills. Yes, we go plenty of places, but the Amazon delivery mobile has us programmed into their GPS. A couple of points though - We do not have an expensive home, nor do we want one. If anything, we want simpler. I also drive an old, old car. It's not a classic, or anything close to it. It is just ancient. Those two facts alone save us a few thousand dollars a month. This year, we may not take a vacation that includes airfare. We will probably opt for some place in the Appalachian Mountains instead - one of my favorite places on earth. Among our \"fly to\" vacations, I've prepared heavily for Northern Ireland and Santa Fe. I'm not sure what prevented me from taking full advantage of NYC and Colorado Springs. I had a good time in both places but I left a lot on the table.</p>\n<p>The places I like to go to are more often the places we can drive to - or places we can park and hike to. Some touristy sites are fun to visit, but I enjoy exploring a new patch of woods a lot too. Whatever I do, I want to do it with Wonder Woman. Sometimes I feel like she has a stronger sense of adventure, but I think we're actually evenly matched. Her personality is such that she is usually happier to let me pick out the next adventure (I'm not fooling myself, either. I read about why that is true in a book). When I'm feeling tired, and she expresses a desire to do something, it just seems odd, out of the ordinary. It's just that I feel tired more frequently than she does.</p>\n<p>I do sometimes feel guilty for buying things. A decluttering spree made me less inclined to buy several types of items: clothes, pots and pans, used books, random personal care stuff. I try to be mindful about what I buy lately. I ask myself if an item will help me feel happier. Will it help me reach a goal? What triggered my desire for it?</p>\n<p>Anyway, I think I need to let go of some of the guilt, as long as I am willing to be a good steward of our the money we have and as long as I would always rather go somewhere new, than go shopping for something flashy. I don't need flashy.</p>\n<p>I love to track things. I have an app to bookmark places. In the past 10 years, we have visited 76 parks, stayed in 44 hotels/VRBO,  visited 28 coffee shops, 14 book stores and eaten in 352 restaurants. I want to at least match that in the next 10 years!<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

They all has faults, but, excluding the current White House resident, two of them were exceptionally bad people and presidents. I am referring, of course to Richard Nixon who not only ran a criminal conspiracy from the oval office to cover up the Watergate crimes, he also less famously prolonged the Vietnam war by sabotaging peace negotiations between the Johnson Administration and North Vietnam. The other spectacular failure was George W. Bush who lied the Ameican people into a two-trillion dollar failure of a war. If that weren't bad enough, he also was running the country when the world financial system almost collapsed due to his negligence, causing the worst  economic conditions in the US since the Great Depression.</p>\n<p>Isn't it odd then, that the current criminal fascist at the head of the US government does something <strong>almost every day</strong> as bad as the worst of Nixon and Bush? I mean, theguy already has 34 felony convictions. He owes $84 million to a woman he sexually assaulted and then defamed. He is openly racist and has been recorded on video bragging about grabbing women \"by the pussy.\"</p>\n<p>Just for the lolz, here is what we used to consider bad presidenting.</p>\n<h2 id=nixon>Nixon</h2><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/USHistory/comments/1b4w449/whats_the_worst_thing_each_us_president_has_done/'>What’s the worst thing each US President has done while in office?

				"content_text": "<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n  <img src=\"https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2025/kim.webp\" alt=\"Prodigy_logo\">\n</div>\n<p>When you meet someone named William, and they tell you they prefer to be called Bill, almost all of us do the one rational and sane thing that the situation calls for. We call them Bill. If their name is William, and they ask to be called Chip, all the non-crazy people in their circle call them Chip. Not only is it basic human decency to call people what they want to be called, it's also the path of the least resistance. It causes exactly zero problems, and it actually prevents conflicts that would be caused by some idiot's stupid obstinacy in insisting that the only rational name to call anyone is the name on their birth certificate. It's no one else's business why any of us choose to be called by our preferred name. Whatever the reason is for your choice or mine, it is good enough.</p>\n<p>My middle name happens to be Kimbal. When you shorten it, as most people did when that was the name I went by, it's Kim. From birth to the first couple of years of school, Kim is the name I used when introducing myself. It's what I wrote on my first and second grade spelling tests, right there at the top on the line labeled \"Name\". Because kids are assholes, some of them decided that my name didn't conform to the gender norms they thought were acceptable, In other words, they thought Kim was a girl's name. Since I am not a girl and have never identified as a girl and because I had that traditional social conditioning that anything that challenges one's manliness is bad, even if for a six-year-old, I was greatly offended. It made me mad enough to cry, which made me even more mad.  Since I was then a pissed off, crying, immature little boy-child with poor coping skills, my next step was usually to make the socially unacceptable choice of attempting to beat someone's ass. That was frowned on, and I got lectured on how I should just ignore mean people. Well, that was bullshit then and it is bullshit now.</p>\n<p>I eventually caved to pressure, tried a few other names and ended up going by Lou, which is a perfectly fine name, I suppose, but not the one that I was used to.</p>\n<p>Now, you probably know where I am going with this. Most people who are going to read this most likely don't have an issue calling people what they want to be called. If they wish to be called Mary, even though the name on their birth certificate is William, most people  who read the rants of this particular progressive old white guy, are cool enough to call that person Mary. If Mary asks, quite naturally that you say she and her when you refer to her, then the people I like, are going to say OK, and do exactly that. They do it because they aren't crazy and they aren't assholes. They have manners and basic human decency. They are not needlessly antagonistic, and they would rather not make another human being feel bad for absolutely no reason. Good for them!</p>\n<p>The only reason to refuse to call someone by their preferred name, gender, and pronouns is that you are morally deficient. You are a flawed human being with untreated personality issues. You are probably cruel in other ways that make sense to no one apart from your own twisted self. You may know and be friends with some other weirdos who share your flaws, but that doesn't make any of you right. Not only that, but you are most likely still mad at six-year-old me who beat your ass back in 1971 — because you deserved it then, just like you deserve it now.</p>\n<p>Please send this, anonymously if you have to, to anyone in your life who needs to read it.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

Most of the\nones I&#39;ve tried have had issues. Either the company behind them folded\nor the apps had poor privacy policies or were strictly for iOS and\ndrained my battery faster than I liked. These apps are often\nsubscription-based. Google will gladly track your location for free\nusing your device if you let them, but what sane person wants Google of\nall companies knowing their every move?</p>\n\n<p>The one app that consistently delivers added features, accuracy, and\nunsurpassed privacy is <a href=\"https://www.geofency.com/\">Geofency</a>\nby developer <a\nhref=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/karl-heinz-herbel/id891641490\">Karl\nHeinz Herbel</a>. It is a universal app for iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch\nand Mac. I use my iPhone as the default for tracking my location and use\nthe Mac version to pull reports and see my data. Geofency is currently\nat version 9 and has been in the app store for 12 years. Geofency does\nnot do route tracking, so look elsewhere if that&#39;s what you need.\nInstead, it tracks the amount of time you spend at the locations you\nvisit. I used it for years when I worked in a rural county, traveling\nbetween schools. When I needed to complete my expense report, I could\npull all my data from Geofency as well as for my time card. If, for some\nreason, it fails to accurately record a visit (rarely) you can manually\nedit the data.</p>\n\n<p>It is accurate enough that today I use it to determine which buildings\non the campus of the university where I work I have visited during the\ncurrent reporting period. I am able to add notes to any visit to a\nparticular building for later reference. For visits to commercial\nlocations, Geofency connects to Apple Maps to pull phone, address and\nwebsite data. I can automatically export visits to any location to any\ncalendar. The app will even generate a CSV time sheet for any time\nperiod I specify for any location. I can customize the locations by\nrenaming them or resizing the spatial radius Geofency recognizes,\nhelpful for separate locations near one another.</p>\n\n<p>None of your Geofency data is collected by the developer. It all lives\nin your iCloud account only.</p>\n\n<p>The iOS app features live activities and widgets. I would gladly pay a\nhigher price for this app I have now used for over a decade, but it is\nstill only $4.99 as a one-time purchase in. the <a\nhref=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/geofency-time-tracking/id615538630\">App\nStore.</a></p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Geofency - Location Based Time Tracking' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2025/four.webp\" alt=\"four\" /></p>\n<p>My Dad can be aggravating every so often. He's  conservative and opinionated and not a little arrogant. He got religion about thirty years ago and that made it worse. Despite all of that, he is as entertaining as anyone I have ever known for one reason. He is a supremely skilled and captivating storyteller. Granted, most of the stories are about him, but he's lived an interesting life, and he weaves all sorts of different elements into his tales. Unlike many combat veterans, he loves to talk about his time at war. It's rarely about the ugly parts. Usually, he has funny stories about different men in his unit during his first tour in Vietnam or men he flew with during his second tour.</p>\n<p>One of my favorite stories is the one about one of his young soldiers who Dad said was the happiest American in Vietnam. Dad was a second lieutenant in charge of a platoon on armored cavalry soldiers. He knew this private stateside, before they deployed because the kid had gone through training at Ft. Know while Dad was also stationed there. He's found the private crying one day outside the barracks and with his best fatherly attitude (he was 21 at the time), asked the kid \"What's the matter son?\"</p>\n<p>\"Sir,\" the young man answered, \"My girlfriend, she's going to have a baby.\" My Dad assured him that he could arrange leave for him to go home and \"make things right.\" \"But sir, you don't understand. Her Mom.\"</p>\n<p>Dad asked,\"What about her Mom, son\"</p>\n<p>\"Sir, she's pregnant too.\"</p>\n<p>Dad said it took a few seconds for the situation to become clear. Yes, the answer is yes. This young draftee from Nowheresville, Oklahoma had gotten both his girlfriend and her mother in the family way at the same time and then left for the Army. So, yeah, when he ended up in the jungles of Vietnam fighting a way, he was relieved that he wasn't back home being murdered by two irate women.</p>\n<p>Telling stories runs in the family, though. My grandfather never presented himself as a military man, although he had been on active duty before Pearl Harbor and didn't get discharged until 1946. His World War Two stories were mainly about geography and culture. The National Guard unit he joined during the depression had been activated and sent to Trinidad in the later 30s. He pronounced it Trinny-dad. There was, of course, no combat there, but he played a lot of baseball. He'd been all over the states and spent time in England before landing in mainland Europe where he proclaimed to he's gone all the way across France and Germany until he \"hugged necks with the Russians at the Elbe River.\" Some of his stories were harrowing in their own way. His unit liberated a German POW camp holding Russian prisoners. Before running from the approaching US Army, the Nazis turned loose their Alsatian dogs on their prisoners in a final spurt of brutality. The Russians, rather than scrambling in fear, instead caught the dogs and promptly ate them. I heard that story many times and thinking about it today reinforces the \"war is hell\" ethos like no other I've ever heard personally.</p>\n<p>Some of my stories also take an ironic turn like that. I was in the military during the Cold War, so I thankfully, I have no combat tales. My personal war stories are from working manhunts after prison escapes. The most surreal moment from that period was when I was sent to escort a bloodhound handler into a patch of woods, where minutes before three prisoners who'd managed to penetrate a fence fled under gunfire. Two of the prisoners were being held at the prison where I worked even though they hadn't been convicted yet. They'd escaped from jail and were being held at my unit because they were a security risk. Yeah, no shit. Since they were not yet convicted felons, the \"shoot on sight\" law that is supposed to keep criminals from climbing fences technically did not apply to them. Thus, my captain as he pushed me into the woods to look for then cautioned me to \"Try not to shoot them.\" <a href='https://louplummer.lol/prison-break/'>Read the whole story.</a></p>\n<p>Those stories are memorable, but they aren't my favorites. I loved to listen to my grandmother's tales of cooking for her six brothers on a wood stove, trying in vain to quell their appetites after they'd spent the days plowing with mules. I also love to hear my mother recount her early hardscrabble life living in an old farmhouse without running water or adequate heat where sometimes the hot water bottle she took to bed with her would fall to the floor where she'd find it frozen in the morning when she crawled from under the quilts.</p>\n<p>It's not just the older generation that can spin a story. My kids love to elaborate on the things they did to exasperate me when they were growing up. My oldest daughter, who I dearly love, has and has always had a slightly sharp tongue. She used it one too many times on a trip home from a friends' lake house one day back in the 90s and I turned around in the car to pop her on the leg as a warning, except I didn't. I tagged her brother, who, while not an angel, was an innocent bystander in this case. \"Dad, you got me!\" was his indignant response. I was doubly furious. When we finally got home, my daughter, sensing that she had pushed things too far, climbed over the other children in  the back seat and took off running as fast as she could with me chasing her. Lucky for both of us, I didn't catch her. Not funny at the time but hilarious to hear then tell it now.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2025/54-3.webp\" alt=\"PDF_Logo_Laptop\" /></p>\n<p>First off, just let me say I hate PDFs in the workplace because even in 2025, few people understand all the ins and outs of working with them. All they know is that the boss needs to buy them or IT needs to give them some expensive software, preferably top of the line Adobe software, so they can do what they want with a single damn document they got from some seminar.</p>\n<p>If you occasionally work with documents saved as PDFs, you can probably avoid purchasing, or worse, subscribing to expensive services to create, join, split, annotate and convert files. The key word is occasionally. If your everyday workflow involves working with PDFs all day, you need to go ahead and invest in the tools you need.</p>\n<p>Both Macs and PCs can create PDF files from just about any file you can print. Where folks run into trouble is when they get a PDF file created by someone else, and they want to edit it as if it were a Word document. It is not. When you look at a PDF, you are essentially looking at a picture of a document rather than an original. Still, depending on your pain point, there are free tools you can use to make some modifications to PDFs.</p>\n<p>There are also free tools to do OCR (object character recognition) on PDF files so that you can search the text in them for keywords. Not every PDF has a searchable layer. It can be created if it doesn't exist, but it isn't always there by default.</p>\n<p>One last bomb blast from your IT guy - do not come at me with some 1GB 800-page PDF full of tiny text and full color pictures and complain about anything because you are asking for trouble if you expect to work with files like that.

For less than $20 you\nget a Photoshop compatible application, either from <a\nhref=\"https://secure.flyingmeat.com/acorn/\">the developer&#39;s website</a>\nor the <a\nhref=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/acorn-8/id6737921844?mt=12\">App\nStore.</a>The feature set is long and varied, but the interface isn&#39;t\noverly complicated, and you don&#39;t need to buy an 800-page book to\nexplain the ins and outs of using it. A two-time Apple award winner,\nit&#39;s a one-time purchase of $19.99, and you get access to extensive\nonline documentation, a user forum and tech support. The current version\nis a universal binary compatible with macOS 14 and 15, but earlier\nversions can still be downloaded.</p>\n\n<h2>New Features in Latest Version</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>AI subject selection</li>\n<li>Live text tool</li>\n<li>Data-driven graphics</li>\n<li>On canvas ruler</li>\n<li>JPEG-XL support</li>\n<li>Look up tables (LUTs)</li>\n<li>Super resolution (upscaling)</li>\n<li>Extensive export support</li>\n<li>Apple shortcut support</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Basic Use Cases</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Design logos and custom typography by adding text to paths or shapes.</li>\n<li>Remove backgrounds using Magic Wand and Instant Alpha Eraser.</li>\n<li>Combine images to create collages and layouts.</li>\n<li>Retouch images with Clone, Dodge, and Burn.</li>\n<li>Adjust contrast, highlights, and shadows with Levels and Curves.</li>\n<li>Export professionally with customizable color profiles, file formats, and precise size control.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Extended Feature Set</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Layer capabilities</li>\n<li>Filters, effects and styles</li>\n<li>Basic and custom brushes (including Adobe imports)</li>\n<li>Magic Wand shapes</li>\n<li>Vector support</li>\n<li>Supports multiple file types</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you only need basic features, like image conversion, compression and\nresizing, there are programs with smaller feature sets to accomplish\nthose tasks. If.

Earlier tonight i shared the news that I've decided to stop working at the university where I've been full time since 2022. My new ambition is to be able to devote my time to writing in a way I never have been able to before. Writing is what brings me the most joy these days but I have had to cram it into a life with a full time job, family time that I treasure and trying to be a supportive husband to Wonder Woman. I've always enjoyed helping people with technology issues, so my job wasn't unenjoyable, but like any workplace, sometimes personalities and politics get in the way of the mission. Well, not any more, not for me. My last day in my 50s will be my last day as an employee. My first day of the final retirement is going to be my 60th birthday.</p>\n<p>This is the real culmination of a dream I've had for a while. There are so many things in my life that have taken a back seat. I'll have time to cook again. I won't have to go for walks in the coldest hour of the day. I can spend evenings doing things with Wonder Woman as opposed to doing things near her.</p>\n<p>My vision  for writing is to be able to spend more time developing ideas, spending some time mind mapping or outlining what I want to write about. I may even start proofreading before I publish! Usually my editing is of the oh, shit variety, after I spot a mistake or three on a live blog post. I get email from developers fairly regularly asking me to consider reviewing their apps and now I will have time to do more of that. It would really make me happy to be able to lend a hand to someone who comes up with a great idea to get more attention for their work. I don't have the stress or pressure faced by commercial journalists.</p>\n<p>For this blog, where tech takes a back seat and I tend to write more autobiographical prose along with social commentary, nothing will change about the format or direction. I'll just be able to develop some ideas more fully. It is a precarious moment in time. Documenting how we get through these next four years is important. I want to be a part of a support network of progressive voices who advocate for diversity, equity and inclusion in the face of an assault on vulnerable people. Activists absolutely need to be in the streets,  but no one should discount building communities online. If the right wing's Internet presence is a problem for the left, the same can be true in reverse.  Keeping people engaged and involved and ready to vote isn't a given. I'm not planning to become a pundit. I just want to be the same outspoken citizen I have tried to be since conservatism turned so poisonous.</p>\n<p>I am excited and happy. Life is awesome. <BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

I quit my job. Technically, leaving my previous job wasn't quitting. It was retiring. I spent 27 years working for the state of NC before sailing off into the sunset. I ended up not liking my first shot at retirement, but I think this time will be different. For the past two years I've been an end user support specialist at a private university in the town where I live. The students and 99% of the faculty were great to work with. The atmosphere in tech has really changed though. A lot of time and energy is spent on what is essentially security theater. While there is information the law requires an IT department do everything in its power to protect, there are also lots of restrictions placed on folks that are there purely for show and don't do a damn thing to make data more secure. It makes me crazy. So I turned in my notice. My last day at work will also be my last day in my 50s. My 60th birthday will be the first day of my second retirement.</p>\n<p>To celebrate my impending freedom, I found a few good stories about people leaving jobs to share with you.</p>\n<p><a href='https://notalwaysright.com/tag/quitting/'>Quitting Stories- Funny & True Stories | NotAlwaysRight.com</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yHTaH-taPs'>The CRAZIEST Job Quitting Stories You Will Ever Hear - Don’t Try These Yourself - YouTube</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://careers.alot.com/watercooler/15-hilarious-ways-people-quit-their-jobs--17538'>30 Hilarious Ways People Quit Their Jobs</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/4-wild-quitting-job-stories'>4 of the wildest quitting stories we've ever heard</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://cheezburger.com/25298181/im-outta-here-employees-share-stories-about-quitting-on-the-first-day'>‘I’m outta here': Employees Share Stories About Quitting on the First Day - FAIL Blog - Funny Fails</a></p>\n<BR>\n<BR>[Enjoyed it?

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2025/ireland-2.webp\" alt=\"ireland-2\" /></p>\n<p>This month, the topic for those participating in the <a href='https://indieweb.org/IndieWeb_Carnival'>monthly IndieWeb Carnival</a> is \"<a href='https://artlung.com/affirmations-ic/'>affirmations</a>.\" I've long enjoyed reading poetry and collecting quotes. I will stop whatever I am doing if I hear a recording of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. or Winston Churchill, two of the greatest speakers to ever be recorded. I am inordinately fond of the power of language. Several years ago, I decided to see if it was possible to <a href='https://bearblog.dev/livingoutloud/dashboard/posts/ruDXZGvJqczmrmkeMrKC/'>achieve happiness through adopting positive behaviors.</a>  Among the many things I tried over the course of the year-long experiment was internalizing affirmations. I didn't use an app for it or search through my quotes collection. Instead, I looked at the parts of my life that caused me the most stress. Then, I flipped that by determining what my favorite things were about myself.</p>\n<h2 id=affirmations-for-stress>Affirmations for Stress</h2><p>The year I undertook this project was one of changes. After 15 years of working in elementary and middle schools supporting teachers and students using Apple computers, I switched to working in high schools where everything was Windows-based. I transitioned from using computers and software with which I was intimately familiar, to systems I loathed and had done my best to avoid for a long time. Not only that, I was faced with learning the ins and outs of the faculty and staff at four giant campuses. I went from a life on cruise control to one where the stress level was ramped up by the demands of high-stakes online testing, students striving for college admissions and ramped up security concerns.</p>\n<p>Since I was trying everything in my power to make that year the best I could, I used two affirmations, which I wrote out by hand in a notebook every morning.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>I react calmly to stressful situations</strong></li>\n<li><strong>I am intelligent and resourceful. I find solutions to problems. I am not defeated by them.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>I repeated those affirmations to myself before I got out of my car in the mornings as work and I had post-it notes taped to my laptop as constant reminders. I was doing a lot of other positive things that year, meditating, walking several miles a day, striving for eight hours of sleep a night, eating healthy. Combining all of those things did, in fact, keep the stress level down. Despite my misgivings, I finished out my career truly enjoying the time I spent working with older students and adapting to a whole new workflow.</p>\n<h2 id=having-a-purpose>Having a Purpose</h2><p>The other word game i played with myself, not only that one year but right until this very day was taking the time to determine my purpose. What is it I'm on earth to do? It's a hallmark of my personality to like the things I like as much as I possibly can. I am not one to dip my toe into the pool. I do a cannonball. Because I am usually convinced that my latest passion is the best thing ever, I naturally try to convince other people to take part. When I started rescuing parrots, I had two aviaries built at my house within a year. I set up anyone who was interested with a bird of their own and helped them outfit a habitat and choose the right food. When I was into cycling, my greatest joy was helping people train for and complete their first 100-mile bike rides. When it comes to tech, I have spent the past thirty years showing people how to use various gadgets and programs to be more productive and creative. With blogging, I went from one blog to four in just a few months and I evangelize for the IndieWeb every chance I get.</p>\n<p><strong>My Purpose — To let my curiosity and enthusiasm create and nurture passions I can share with others.</strong><BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

Tapestry is an aggregator that creates a\ncombined timeline from a long list of possible sources including :</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>RSS feeds</li>\n<li>YouTube channels</li>\n<li>Podcasts</li>\n<li>Mastodon</li>\n<li>Bluesky</li>\n<li>Micro.blog</li>\n<li>Tumblr</li>\n<li>Reddit</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Items in your timeline are shown in chronological order. There is no\nalgorithm. Searching within Tapestry searches across all feeds.\nLikewise, setting a mute filter for terms such as &quot;Elon Musk&quot; will block\ncontent from every source. Content from different sources is color coded\nto make readily apparent which resource your information is coming from.\nIf you install Tapestry on a phone and an iPad, your reading position\nsyncs across devices via iCloud. You can combine sources in any way you\nwant to have your own custom feeds. I am still experimenting, but so far\nI created the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Personal bloggers</li>\n<li>Hard news</li>\n<li>Tech news</li>\n<li>Combined Mastodon and Bluesky home feeds</li>\n<li>Favorite individual social media feeds, since you can add a feed for a single account holder (e.g. Kottke, AOC, Joan Westenberg)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The settings allow you to choose an icon, a theme and a font for the\ntimeline. You can use the in app browser or your default browser to view\ncontent. I recommend doing that so you can view content using reader\nmode. Reddit links open in the Reddit app. Mastodon links open in my\nbrowser, although I can use the share sheet to open them in my preferred\napp. Tapestry also has bookmarks.</p>\n\n<p><br />The privacy policy states that all searches take place on your\ndevice. The developers do not collect any data.</p>\n\n<p>Iconfactory offers monthly subscriptions for $1.99, yearly for $19.99\nand a one time purchase for $79.99. A Mac version is in the works, but\nis not here yet. There is a free version with limited features.

Tapestry is an aggregator that creates a\ncombined timeline from a long list of possible sources including :</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>RSS feeds</li>\n<li>YouTube channels</li>\n<li>Podcasts</li>\n<li>Mastodon</li>\n<li>Bluesky</li>\n<li>Micro.blog</li>\n<li>Tumblr</li>\n<li>Reddit</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Items in your timeline are shown in chronological order. There is no\nalgorithm. Searching within Tapestry searches across all feeds.\nLikewise, setting a mute filter for terms such as &quot;Elon Musk&quot; will block\ncontent from every source. Content from different sources is color coded\nto make readily apparent which resource your information is coming from.\nIf you install Tapestry on a phone and an iPad, your reading position\nsyncs across devices via iCloud. You can combine sources in any way you\nwant to have your own custom feeds. I am still experimenting, but so far\nI created the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Personal bloggers</li>\n<li>Hard news</li>\n<li>Tech news</li>\n<li>Combined Mastodon and Bluesky home feeds</li>\n<li>Favorite individual social media feeds, since you can add a feed for a single account holder (e.g. Kottke, AOC, Joan Westenberg)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The settings allow you to choose an icon, a theme and a font for the\ntimeline. You can use the in app browser or your default browser to view\ncontent. I recommend doing that so you can view content using reader\nmode. Reddit links open in the Reddit app. Mastodon links open in my\nbrowser, although I can use the share sheet to open them in my preferred\napp. Tapestry also has bookmarks.</p>\n\n<p><br />The privacy policy states that all searches take place on your\ndevice. The developers do not collect any data.</p>\n\n<p>Iconfactory offers monthly subscriptions for $1.99, yearly for $19.99\nand a one time purchase for $79.99. A Mac version is in the works, but\nis not here yet. There is a free version with limited features.

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2025/cb.webp\" alt=\"CostBenefit\" /></p>\n<p>When making a decision is easy, it is because there is little to no downside to taking action. I decide to get up early most mornings because I treasure being able to relax with coffee before heading to my office. I choose to be polite to most people I deal with because making people smile and being helpful makes me feel good. Those are easy choices to make for me today, although they are more difficult for some. Getting out of bed is a real challenge when you are depressed. Engaging with people in a friendly way can be intimidating for the painfully shy or introverted folks who do not want to invite uncomfortable small talk.</p>\n<p>Often times, deciding to do something that's supposed to be good for me can be challenging. Currently, I am really struggling to be more physically active. I've used the fact that I had my knees replaced a few years back to serve as my excuse for not walking, an activity that I've enjoyed most of my life. I walked before work and at lunch for years, listening to podcasts and books or just enjoying the sounds from the local park or the neighborhood. Now, to my utter embarrassment, even short walks leave me breathing uncomfortably hard. My pace is glacial. To alleviate that, I'll have to put up with it until my body starts to adapt to the increased activity. I'll get to spend less time comfortably reading on my couch. That is the only downside. The upside is weight loss, better health, a longer life expectancy and no longer gasping for air anytime I have to walk uphill. Sounds like a no-brainer, but it hasn't been easy to decide to take the first walk.</p>\n<p>Then there are other times when it's not obvious what the best course of action is. Life in America for people with the values I hold dear is full of outrage right now. Every day we find out about some horrible new thing the fascists are doing to vulnerable people. Today I learned that they've removed access to information on a host of topics including hate crime data, military suicides, teen dating violence and access to victim's compensation. It makes me crazy. Of course, I could easily filter out that news and read about new laptops and predictions for the next iPhone. I could just declare that my mental health is too important to risk being constantly angry about things I cannot control. I'm not going to do that, of course, due to having a conscience and not wanting to be a selfish older white guy who acts like nobody else matters as long as I've got mine. That's the attitude that let MAGA take over in the first place.</p>\n<p>Every so often it is helpful to make lists of pros and cons or to seek counsel from friends, whether they be IRL or from online communities. Other times, going with my gut instinct is the only thing I can do. Every single day is full of choices. Because I am a world-class procrastinator, my choice is often to just wait on more information. That can sometimes be good, frequently it isn't, But, I give myself a break. Like almost everybody, I am doing the best I can with what I've got to work with. I just have to keep moving forward.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

If malware or a\nbad actor gains control of the administrator account, they could\npotentially install unwanted applications, alter system settings, or\naccess or delete sensitive data. Limiting the use of an administrator\naccount helps to mitigate these risks. Unfortunately, most people\nconsider it a huge hassle to use the standard Mac method of temporarily\nelevating the privileges of a standard account.

Users can set a\nspecific timeframe in the app&#39;s settings to handle tasks like installing\nor uninstalling applications. To request admin rights, just click the\nPrivileges icon in your Dock or menu bar. Using a standard user account\ninstead of an administrator enhances your Mac&#39;s security and is a best\npractice.

If malware or a\nbad actor gains control of the administrator account, they could\npotentially install unwanted applications, alter system settings, or\naccess or delete sensitive data. Limiting the use of an administrator\naccount helps to mitigate these risks. Unfortunately, most people\nconsider it a huge hassle to use the standard Mac method of temporarily\nelevating the privileges of a standard account. So they just accept the\nrisk and use an admin account anyway. You don&#39;t have to be like them.</p>\n\n<p>Use the free app, <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/SAP/macOS-enterprise-privileges\">Privileges</a>,\na macOS application that lets users perform daily tasks as a standard\nuser while easily requesting administrator rights. Users can set a\nspecific timeframe in the app&#39;s settings to handle tasks like installing\nor uninstalling applications. To request admin rights, just click the\nPrivileges icon in your Dock or menu bar. Using a standard user account\ninstead of an administrator enhances your Mac&#39;s security and is a best\npractice. All users, including developers, can benefit from using\nPrivileges. The app is compatible with macOS 11.x - 15.x. It has\nrecently been updated.</p>\n\n<h2>Features</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Easy install</li>\n<li>Perfect for day-to-day use</li>\n<li>Turn on admin rights anytime</li>\n<li>Enjoy standard user security</li>\n<li>Command line use supported</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://github.com/SAP/macOS-enterprise-privileges\\#new-privileges-21-features-\">New Privileges 2.1 features</a></h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Installer package</li>\n<li>Revoke admin rights at login</li>\n<li>Unified expiration interval for administrator privileges</li>\n<li>Renew expiring administrator privileges</li>\n<li>Run actions on privilege change</li>\n<li>Status item</li>\n<li>Command line tool now also supports Touch ID</li>\n<li>AppleScript support</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You can download the <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/SAP/macOS-enterprise-privileges\">Privileges\ninstaller on GitHub.</a></p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Privileges - Operate Your Mac Safely' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

Every enlisted soldier's introduction to that lifestyle is basic training, a nine week period where other soldiers a few years older than you yell at you a lot and make you do things that don't always make a lot of sense. One of the things they make you do is shave your face every day, whether you need to or not. God help you if your bear growth is faster or heavier than normal, because you will spend much time defending your genetic abnormality to green suited screaming men who do not believe that you adequately groomed yourself that particular morning.</p>\n<p>I've worn facial hair almost all of my post-military life. I don't like to shave. It takes time I'd rather use to something more useful. I don't like the mess, the cleaning up of the mess, the potential for cutting myself, the cost of razors and blades or anything else associated with the ritual society inflicts on us.</p>\n<p>The freaks who perpetuate the idea that shaving is necessary have existed throughout history.

It's only fitting that I end up participating in this current iteration of the blogging question challenge.</p>\n<p>I was challenged by Kyle - <a href='https://weblog.kylereddoch.me/2025/02/blog-questions-challenge-technology-edition'>Blog Questions Challenge: Technology Edition - Kyle's Tech Korner</a></p>\n<h3 id=when-did-you-first-get-interested-in-technology>When Did You First Get Interested In Technology?</h3><p>I started late. For years, I avoided anything related to computers because I thought they required something I didn't have — advanced math skills. I associated them with the brainy guys who read books on physics from high school. My brother was one of those guys, and he had a computer, so that reinforced my belief. It wasn't until my uncle, whose twin passions were coon hunting and tractor pulls, got a computer that I thought I might be able to learn something about using a PC. It was his DOS 386 where I first logged on to an online community, Prodigy and learned that what you can do with technology is practically limitless. It was December 1993. I was 28.</p>\n<h3 id=whats-your-favorite-piece-of-technology-all-time>What's Your Favorite Piece Of Technology All-Time?</h3><p>It's a toss up between the first computer I built myself and my first Mac, but I'm going with the Titanium Powerbook G4 my job provided me soon after it was released in January 2001. It's the computer I used to transition from the Classic Mac OS to Mac OS X. I used it to run old Mac admin tools like Mac Manager and Network Assistant and the late, great productivity suite, Apple Works. I even had a painfully slow copy of PC Anywhere on it for doing Windows chores required by my job. I was so enamored with Apple tech that I learned more in six months of using that Powerbook than I had in years of Windows usage.</p>\n<h3 id=whats-your-favorite-piece-of-technology-right-now>What's Your Favorite Piece Of Technology Right Now?</h3><p>I have almost every bit of Apple kit one can get apart from AirPods and that dumb ass strap on face computer, no disrespect to anyone who spent $4K on one. And, although I love my phone and never, ever worry about using it too much, my favorite piece of gear is my M2 MacBook Air — the fastest, most responsive laptop I have ever used. I have an M3 iMac at work, but I prefer the MBA. I associate it with fun and learning and all the emotions that come with having done so much writing with it over the past year of non-stop blogging.</p>\n<h3 id=name-one-new-cool-piece-of-technology-well-have-in-25-years>Name One New Cool Piece Of Technology We'll Have In 25 Years!</h3><p>It's my sincere hope that whatever we have in 25 years is a tool developed outside of Silicon Valley and the disturbing privacy invading, autocrat coddling, wealth extracting tendencies of today's big 5 predators: Microsoft, Meta, Apple, Amazon and Google. I love what Apple tech has provided me over the years, but the recent trend by the company and its leadership has been to flout as many laws as it can to extract as much wealth as it can from people like me. There is no longer even any lip service to making the world a better place. In 25 years, I want to be able to use affordable tech that provides value in a 100% ethical way — whatever it looks like.</p>\n<h3 id=final-thoughts>Final Thoughts</h3><p>To me, the primary value in tech is and has always been to connect me with other humans. I am still impressed by tools many take for granted — instant messaging, email, web publishing viewable by anyone in the world within seconds. Computers can and do bring people closer. They can and do spread good ideas and empower people. Of course, they also do the opposite some times, but I have hope that the arc will swing into the light.</p>\n<p>I'd like to see what @jarunmb@techhub.social, @dhry@mastodon.socialmastodon.social and @mbjones@social.lol have to say.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

Here are my favorites from the\nrecent additions:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://arthursmithdev.gumroad.com/l/AutoShot\">AutoShot -\nAutomatic screenshots in set intervals</a> - This app automatically\ntakes a screenshot of your workspace at intervals you specify and even\nif you are using multiple monitors. You can choose the file format you\nwant to use for the screenshots and where they are kept in your file\nstructure. You can alleviate concerns about excessive disk usage by\nsetting auto-delete parameters. <strong>(Free)</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://getsprinkles.app/\">Sprinkles – Customize any\nwebsite</a> - One of the features that Arc browser users like is the\nability to apply custom CSS to websites. With Sprinkles, you can bring\nthat functionality to Safari, Chrome and Firefox. Sprinkles runs a tiny\nwebserver on your machine. When you visit a website, the browser\nextension asks this server for scripts. The server looks for 4 files in\nyour Sprinkles scripts directory:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>global.js</li>\n<li>global.css</li>\n<li>github.com.js</li>\n<li>github.com.css</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>When there&#39;s a hit, the extension adds the provided JS and CSS.\n<strong>(Free)</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mburakerman.github.io/mackernews/\">Mackernews</a> - If\nyou frequent Hackernews to see the latest goings-on in the tech world,\nthis tiny app makes it easy to see and connect to the latest hot\nstories. Just choose the headline from a dropdown menu and instantly\nload the story. <strong>(Free)</strong></p>\n\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/autorun-run-apps/id6739644500\">AutoRun\n- Run Apps. Mac App Store</a> - This simple app can be used to launch\napps or run scripts at a specific time or at regular intervals. Some\npossible use cases:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Run Applescript to eject backup disk before you wake up so you can just disconnect it</li>\n<li>Launch a file synchronization app once a day to back up folders to cloud drives</li>\n<li>Run scripts to start and stop apps you don't want running simultaneously on two computers</li>\n<li>Automatically launch your task manager, calendar, email and browser every morning just before you wake up <strong>(Free)</strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Latest Apps of Note from Mac Menu Bar' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

Folks are growing increasingly uncomfortable with the amount of information harvested by big tech companies, and increasing uncertain about what those companies are doing with all that they know. Who are they selling it to, and what are they doing with it in turn? Google is at the heart of many people's lives, especially if they use an Android phone or a Chromebook. Many of the rest of us are still using Google as our default search engine. We are using Gmail and Google Drive and Google Docs and any of a dozen other tools and services owned by the company. If you've had enough and would like to try to reduce or eliminate Google from your life, you are going to need help.

By and large, though, the things that people in tech related fields do with our phones, laptops, and tablets fall far, far outside what normies do with theirs. Even further from the norm is what the professional nerds do. Those folks who make their living from monetized blogs, podcast ads, subscriptions and other forms of content are so far removed from what your Mom does with her phone that they could be living on another planet. I saw many bloggers today venting a little over the vapors the content production machine types are having about the new iPads and the fact that those darn folks at Apple just won't listen to them.</p>\n<p>I live at the intersection of normies and tech because I do IT support for a living. I have to talk to your Mom at work in the language she speaks about her computer and her phone. I know, trust me, I really know how much she hates changing her password and how much she really doesn't want to have to download and configure a two-factor authentication app. I know how frustrating it is to search for Microsoft Authenticator in Apple's App Store only to have the number one hit to be a $40 paid app and not the free product from the folks in Redmond. You know what's important to your Mom? That her icons don't move, that's what. Last year, Microsoft had an errant patch Tuesday that ended up removing the Office icons off the desktop of corporate computers.I spent a couple of days explaining to people that, no, we didn't \"delete Word off your computer,\" and talking them through recreating the shortcut. That's a crisis. Not being able to use the Finder on an iPad is not a crisis.</p>\n<p><a href='https://explodingcomma.com/2024/05/15/the-contingent-of.html'>Pete Brown said it well</a>, \"the vast majority of iPad owners are using the device to read Kindle books, play Candy Crush, and take bad photos.\" There are millions of us nerds out there using the best calendar and note-taking apps, but there are tens of millions of people perfectly happy with what Apple or Google gave them. Maybe they have downloaded a few apps (and probably never deleted them) to try out. They might even be pretty good at Instagram, but they are not us. They do not know what version of the operating system they are running on anything. They do not care. They hate updates because they interrupt stuff they'd rather be doing.

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2025/img-8454.webp\" alt=\"IMG_8454\" /></p>\n<p>I appreciate the people who read this blog. I'm grateful for your attention, your comments and for the great blogs so many of you maintain. I'm currently traveling and spending time with family I haven't seen in 10 years. Tonight's post is from April when I was just getting started. Straight from the heart.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Part of my daily routine is to record three things in my daily journal entry for which I'm grateful. I've been doing it for a long time. I try not to be too repetitive, so I'm always on the lookout for things to identify and add to my list. It helps to ask myself that question multiple times a day. I found a good parking spot? Boom! Grateful. My clothes fit particularly comfortably today? Boom! Grateful. A text from one of my grown kids, a tasty lunch at a familiar restaurant, a good report at the dentist - I'm always on the lookout.</p>\n<p>I'm lucky in that I have everything I need even if I don't have everything I want. I learned how to tell the difference between those two things a while back and that skill serves me well. Life is by no means perfect, I weigh too much, some of the people I love the most live too far away to see them as much as I would like. I sometimes regret not getting further along the career path I chose than I did before I retired. All of those things are mitigated by other factors. I've lost weight before. With technology, I can stay in touch with my kids and grandkids fairly easily. I may not have retired as the CIO of a tech company, but I had a solid 8-5, Mon-Fri job that left me plenty of time to do the stuff that really brings me joy.</p>\n<p>I battled alcohol for years, sometimes going long stretches without it, years even, only to fall back into bad habits and addiction. I'm forever going to be grateful that things finally clicked one day. I had a moment of clarity that allowed me to see what kind of future I was headed towards and to also see that I could avoid going there. I took my last drink on December 28th, 2008 and have been continuously sober ever since. Being sober isn't my identity. I'm prouder of things I've done than of the simple act of abstaining, but I'm definitely happy not to have that struggle any more.</p>\n<p>I've been married since I was 18 - to four different people. Luckily my wife and I have been together a dozen years now and it keeps getting better. I don't suffer from the curse of loneliness or the stress of constant fighting. I didn't go to college. I was a two-time teenage parent, and the workforce was always the place for me. I found the IT field around the age of 30 after having been in the military, working construction and in manufacturing and a stint as a prison guard. Once I got into computers I moved through a couple of different industries before landing in educational technology, the area I made a career. Even post-retirement, I missed it enough to take a low stress job at a local university solving problems for end users.</p>\n<p>My wife and I have enough dough that we don't have to worry about the things that used to be terrifying when I was younger: an unexpected car repair bill, medical expenses, the death of a major appliance. We don't have helicopter money but don't have to pinch pennies either. We can afford to help out the kids when they need it. It feels good. I'm not going to lie.  At the end of most days, I go to bed pretty happy. I have enough in my life to keep me busy. I still love technology as much as I did when I bought my first computer (on a Sears card in 1993). I have repaired the damage my bad habits caused in my life. I'm fortunate and I'm grateful and I'm glad to make that list every single day.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2025/silent-valley-2.webp\" alt=\"silent valley-2\" />\n<strong>Silent Valley Reservoir, County Down, Northern Ireland</strong></p>\n<p>I was sitting in a hostel in Maine with multiple other hikers. I asked this good old boy from Tennessee if he'd taken the side trail the day before to see the spectacular overlook from Spaulding Mountain. He looked at me confused and said, \"I wouldn't take a side trail to watch a dragon fight a unicorn.\" He had one thing on his mind, obviously. He was ready to reach Mt. Katahdin and finish the Appalachian Trail.</p>\n<p>Although there are a seeming countless number of beautiful views along what is, after all, called a national scenic trail, most of the journey is spent in what hikers call the green tunnel. You see nothing but trees, rocks and a never-ending footpath. In many places, towering rhododendrons form a literal tunnel, blocking out the sky and any view up or down the mountain you're hiking on.</p>\n<p>I'm from the south and I love the beauty of the Blue Ridge Mountains, but we can't hold a candle to the beauty one experiences in northern New England. Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine are breathtaking over and over. Going above the tree line in the White Mountains is unforgettable. The hundreds of lakes scattered through the dense woods of southern Maine allow you to snap photos every couple of miles worthy of being made into post cards.</p>\n<p>I'm partial to mountains when it comes to looking for landscapes to appreciate. One of the most beautiful days of my life was spent driving the high road to Taos, New Mexico from Santa Fe. There is little to no humidity, unlike what we have in the eastern mountains. So there is no haze. The sky is crystal clear and a clear blue that abruptly changes to many shades of green as your eye moves down to the peaks of the mountains. The mountains are taller than what I'm used to. After all, it is ski country. You can return to Santa Fe along the low road which skirts the Rio Grande in high walled canyons.</p>\n<p>Fans of America's mountains should visit Colorado Springs. From anywhere in town, you can see Pikes Peak. A train ride to the top is only a few doors and is something to put on your bucket list. Also in there are, the Garden of the Gods provides ample opportunities to capture photographs of the landscape and of the big horned sheep who live there.</p>\n<p>For a different kind of beauty, the Mourne Mountains, located in County Down in Northern Ireland are a mostly treeless expanse of grasslands divided by stone fences and few man-made structures. There are a couple high mountain reservoirs that catch the water they need down in Belfast. The few people who do live there are friendly. If you're lucky, you can find a tea shop where you can get a cuppa with a couple of biscuits to sip while you sit beside a peat fire and just take in the wonderful Irishness of it all.</p>\n<p>My bucket list includes seeing the Alps in France, Italy, and Switzerland. Recently, as Internet friend told me that there is a trans-alpine railroad journey from east to west on the South Island of New Zealand that provides some of the best views to be seen on planet Earth, and now I want to go there too. I have no great desire to see Kilimanjaro or the Himalayas, even though the beauty of those places in undeniable. I think the altitudes would do me in.</p>\n<p>What about you?

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2025/opt-2025-01-29-1.webp\" alt=\"Chalkboard\" /></p>\n<p>I enjoy collecting information about the things I do and looking back over it, just as a form of journaling. Since tech is my jam, I try to automate collecting as much information as I can. There isn't a real point to it. I'm not trying to discover anything or achieve some kind of life hack. Currently, I'm not tracking any sort of health data, even though I've got an Apple Watch. It can collect information on heart rate and sleep quality/quantity, both of which I've been interested in before. I even have a digital scale and a blood pressure monitor, both with Wi-Fi to feed information into Apple's health app.</p>\n<p>The type of information I'm interested in these days has more to do with culture and creativity. I use web services that track my television and music consumption automatically. I record the books I read into Goodreads because that information can be exported into other formats. I use a location tracking app that doesn't send the information anywhere other than to my encrypted iCloud account. I also use an app to bookmark notable places I've been, like restaurants, parks, coffee shops and hotels. That app stored its data in a cloud account that only I have access to.</p>\n<p>When I was training for long-distance cycling, data collection had a different flavor because I had numerical goals: trying to hit 10,000 miles and get 30 or more rides of 100 miles completed in a calendar year. My Garmin bike computer recorded all of that, along with speed data plus my heart rate and pedaling cadence. Some people even have power meters on their bikes to determine the wattage they generate on rides. I didn't use Strava, but I did use the Garmin website to store my information.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To record TV shows watched - <a href='https://apps.apple.com/app/id1514873602'>Trakt</a></li>\n<li>Track App Purchases - <a href='https://apps.apple.com/us/app/appraven-apps-gone-free/id1490607195'>AppRaven</a></li>\n<li>To track music - <a href='https://apps.apple.com/us/app/last-fm/id1188681944'>Last.fm</a></li>\n<li>To record books read - <a href='https://apps.apple.com/us/app/goodreads-book-reviews/id355833469'>Goodreads</a></li>\n<li>Private Location Tracking - <a href='https://apps.apple.com/us/app/geofency-time-tracking/id615538630'>Geofency</a></li>\n<li>Location Bookmarking - <a href='https://apps.apple.com/app/id1455145867'>Rego</a></li>\n<li>Step Counting - <a href='https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pedometer/id712286167'>Pedometer++</a></li>\n<li>Heart Rate Data - <a href='https://apps.apple.com/app/id1062745479'>HeartWatch</a></li>\n<li>Sleep Data - <a href='https://apps.apple.com/app/id1164801111'>Autosleep</a></li>\n<li>Walking/Running - <a href='https://apps.apple.com/app/id326498704'>Runmeter</a></li>\n<li>To connect different apps - <a href='https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ifttt-automate-work-and-home/id660944635'>IFTTT</a></li>\n<li>Journal app  - <a href='https://apps.apple.com/us/app/day-one-journal-private-diary/id1044867788'>Day One</a></li>\n<li>Notes App - <a href='https://obsidian.md'>Obsidian</a><BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2025/taco-trailer-resized.webp\" alt=\"taco_trailer-resized\" /></p>\n<p>I remember vividly when I was finally able to go grocery shopping without having to constantly calculate the cumulative cost of the items in my basket. On more than one occasion I had to reluctantly tell the cashier that I'd decided not to get an item or two when my math was bad, and I ended up short while standing at the register. I remember, too, the inability to afford a full tank of gas in the beaters I drove in my early adulthood. I rarely had more than $10 at a time when to buy fuel. When the day came that I could fill up the tank whenever I needed to, I felt like I'd reached a new level in the game of life.</p>\n<p>One of the best mental health practices anyone can adopt is what 12-steppers call an attitude of gratitude. I've been making<a href='https://louplummer.lol/the-gratitude-habit/'>a three-bullet list in my journal</a> for well over a decade. Many days I record nothing but the little luxuries life offers. I'd rather have a whole basket of the little things than a big, fancy car.</p>\n<p>I lived in a 100-year-old farm house in high school. For air conditioning, we had a couple of window units in the house, but none of them reached my bedroom. Our heat was a wood stove. My first adult jobs were mostly of the outdoor type. When I finally scored employment with the state, it was at a prison constructed decades ago. There was no AC, just giant floor fans to blow the hot air around. Subsequently, I moved to a giant Westinghouse factory with a massive machine shop, high ceilings and shipping bay doors open to the summer weather. I'd already turned 30 before I finally made my way into the white-collar world where I could work at a desk, sitting down in air conditioning.</p>\n<p>We didn't eat out much when I was a kid. I'd use my money from whatever little hustles I had going on to occasionally treat myself to some fast food. We lived for a while in Jacksonville, NC and there was a place on the outskirts of town selling three hot dogs for a dollar. I loved that place! To this day, I get more excited than I probably should by the prospect of restaurant food, I don't care how mundane. I'm super happy if I get to go to a taco trailer, and on top of the world if we go to a real sit-down Mexican place with chips and salsa. We could conceivable afford to eat out for every meal, and it's only Wonder Woman's sensibilities that keep from indulging in that.</p>\n<p>I've only slept a new mattress a couple of times in my life. One of those times was just a few years ago when we got one of those foam jobs that comes in a box and expands when you take it out. After relying on cheap hand-me-downs, actually having a quality place to sleep was a luxury I didn't know I needed. It's a rare night when I don't feel incredibly lucky climbing beneath the sheets. My super-power is being able to sleep anywhere at any time under just about any conditions. I can now save that skill for when I really require it.</p>\n<p>There are plenty of other things that make me feel a little like a Rockefeller:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Never, ever going on a road trip without a stop by the Circle K for  soda and a snack</li>\n<li>That first trip to a bathroom with porcelain after spending days upon days on a hiking trip</li>\n<li>Owning and using fleece lined slippers</li>\n<li>Being able to get the fastest Internet you can get to a residential building</li>\n<li>Car repairs that don't go on a credit card</li>\n<li>Rarely saying no to our favorite charities</li>\n<li>Every pair of Levis blue jeans I've ever owned</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'm not a perfect gratitude machine by any means. I despise flying. I am almost always glad to be traveling somewhere, but the miraculous act of hurtling across the country miles up in the sky leaves me singularly unimpressed and grouchy. I also thought email was cool for a while until I realized it was a way other people could add items to my to-do list. Then I didn't like it as much. Still, though, there is enough of that poor kid left in me that any time I buy something and I don't feel forced into getting the cheapest model of whatever it is, I'm amazed on the inside. I feel like I've arrived.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

It is a ruthless profit machine committed to taking advantage of every legal and close to legal loophole it can to \"return value to shareholders.\" That means extracting capital from the working class to put it into the hands of the investor class. I'm an Apple guy, but I am fully aware that the company decided last year to<a href='https://www.pcmag.com/news/patreon-to-creators-sorry-we-have-to-let-apple-take-a-cut-of-in-app-support'> take 30% of Patreon contributions</a> away from podcasters and bloggers and other creators who downloaded the app from the App Store. There was a god-damned thing anybody could do about it, either.</p>\n<p>So, when I mention my love for Apple tech, it is in the context of what the ecosystem allows me to do, which is get work done with tools I enjoy using. I don't feel a kinship with the ghost of Steve Jobs,<a href='https://www.pajiba.com/film_reviews/steve-jobs-was-an-asshole.php'>a miserable bastard if there ever was one</a>.

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2025/brisket.webp\" alt=\"brisket\" /></p>\n<p>My mother believes in participatory humanity. Whatever she's doing, she welcomes you to join right in. Some parents discourage their kids from using household appliances or cooking because I guess they are scared the kids might break something or get hurt. My Mom does not have that fear. I don't remember not knowing how to start a load of clothes in the washing machine, turn on the dryer (after cleaning the lint filter because you don't want the house burning down) and I certainly don't remember feeling helpless or lost in the kitchen.</p>\n<p>I remember being tasked with cooking bacon for breakfast. Mom had these distinct tongs used for just that purpose. A few years ago, when I mentioned how I'd never been able to find a set like that for myself, she gave me hers, the same ones I used 50 years ago as a kid. I know for a fact that some food prep tasks she handed off to me were things she hated doing herself. Grating cabbage for coleslaw is a prime example. I'm willing to bet she only has it when I'm visiting her, and she can rope me into doing it.  I didn't mind helping, actually. Back in the day, we didn't worry about raw eggs in cake batter and getting to lick the batter from the mixing bowl or the beaters from her handheld mixer was a rite of passage.</p>\n<p>I left home as a teenager and got married. My wife could cook and enjoyed making fancy dishes, but I took on the day in and day out food prep duties. She was a military brat and didn't know much about Southern cooking, My grandmother advised her to season vegetables with a little grease, as we do down here. Mema was referring to pork grease, rendered from fatback or bacon, but the young lady I was married to didn't catch that part and soon poured hamburger drippings all over a pot of green beans and  didn't understand why they weren't as tasty as she expected.</p>\n<p>My kids all managed to make it into adulthood without dying of malnutrition. Their food memories tend to center on things they didn't like  rather than all the delicious meals I prepared for them. My son, was the kind of kid who ordered chicken fingers and french fries at Mexican restaurants, has excellent taste as an adult and an adventurous palate, but he swears that the only way he survived his teenage years was by begging me to let him make extra sandwiches to eat in his room. My girls favorite food group was cereal. The happiest days of their lives were the times when I'd buy something apart from raisin bran.</p>\n<p>After the kids left home, and I was heavily involved in endurance sports, I learned a lot about nutrition and training. Some of my favorite activities burned massive amounts of calories. I was dedicated to clean eating and went through chicken breasts, sweet potatoes, bags of spinach and cage free eggs like mad. When Wonder Woman and I got married, she was just as dedicated to that diet as I was. She still is, although not quite as rigidly as before. She still prefers brown rice over white rice. I've never known her to eat canned vegetables. For years, she prepared  a week's worth of the most colorful salads imaginable every Sunday, and we ate them for lunch during the week,</p>\n<p>Since I decided I didn't like being retired and went back to work, we've opted for meals that are quick and easy to prepare so we can have more leisure time at night. I've promised to go back to more cooking from scratch when I finally retire for good. I have a quite nice grill and smoker combo that hasn't gotten a lot of use lately. It does great pork shoulders, beef brisket, whole chickens and turkey breasts. I need to fire that back up soon.</p>\n<p>I get the same complaints other male cooks get, primarily centered around being messy, which is true. I am messy. It took me a while to learn how to judge the right portion sizes for my diminutive wife, who, while indeed small, also has to stay fueled up for ultramarathon training. I have also learned that by some miracle of modern medical science, I am to blame for any numbers on the reports she gets after her physical that she doesn't like. Either I'm not serving enough foods rich in vitamin D, or I'm screwing up her HDL and LDL readings.</p>\n<p>She still loves me though and readily accepts her plate each night when I deliver hot chow to her after she's waited for me to prepare dinner for us. Few things make me happier than to see her dig into whatever I've made.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

Of all the people that are going to get screwed over in the coming years, I'll probably be in the group that suffers the least real damage and yet I can not shut up about what's happening. People are freaking out and they have every reason to be. I get it that you are bored with it all. That you'd prefer not to be constantly reminded of how horrible things are for people. Just keep that to yourself. Go spend some time alone. Don't try to police what people want to talk about in the Year of Our Lord 2025, because a lot of them want to talk about how an evil bunch of people are attacking some of the most vulnerable members of society.<BR><BR><BR>\n<img src=\"https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2025/opt-2025-01-27-1-10.webp\" alt=\"opt-2025-01-27-%1_10\" /></p>\n<p><BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

For hundreds of years, the lifestyles of most societies on earth were not remarkably different than what had been common one, two or even three hundred years or more into the past.

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2025/38-3.webp\" alt=\"Habits\" /></p>\n<p>In the fall of 2017 I got the urge to investigate self-improvement in a methodical and purposeful way after reading <em>The Happiness Project</em> by Gretchen Rubin, an Ivy League educated attorney and former Supreme Court law clerk who gave all that up to become a writer. I wanted no part of any self-help, psychobabble, New Age flavored literature. I decided to come up with a plan based on scientific studies of practices that would improve my life physically and mentally. Some of the other books I read include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18505796-10-happier'>10% Happier by Dan Harris</a></li>\n<li><a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18476763-diet-cults'>Diet Cults: The Surprising Fallacy at the Core of Nutrition Fads and a Guide to Healthy Eating for the Rest of US by Matt Fitzgerald</a></li>\n<li><a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13542978-willpower'>Willpower: Rediscovering the Greatest Human Strength by Roy F. Baumeister</a></li>\n<li><a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6500848-never-let-go?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=Qh7iqb0Ahy&amp;rank=2'>Never Let Go: A Philosophy of Lifting, Living and Learning by Dan John</a></li>\n<li><a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22934427-focus'>Focus: The Hidden Driver of Excellence by Daniel Goleman</a></li>\n<li><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow'>Thinking, Fast and Slow By Daniel Kaneman</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>By January 1, 2018, I was ready. I had a list of goals, spreadsheets, apps for tracking various habits and a folder of bookmarks on the idea of the quantified self. My primary goals were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Average walking four miles a day for the entire year, counting only purposeful walks and not steps taken in the course of the day.</li>\n<li>Get a minimum of 10,000 steps every day</li>\n<li>Close the rings on my Apple Watch activity tracker every day requiring at least 30 minutes of exercise, 800 calories burned and no prolonged sitting over 12 hours each day</li>\n<li>Meditate every day in a sitting position, alone using a timer</li>\n<li>Read 52 books</li>\n<li>Deadlift and squat 400 lbs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Out of pure stubbornness, I hit every one of those goals. I once had to go for a walk during a hurricane, but I managed to get my steps that day. I was blessed with good health the entire year, maintaining a healthy weight and dealing with my arthritis successfully.</p>\n<p>It was fun, and I am glad that I did it, but it was not the happiest year of my life, which is what I was going for. It wasn't that it was bad, not at all, but it didn't elevate me to a new plane of existence or anything. It was a series of tasks that took self-discipline and dedication, not much different than other challenges I'd given myself through cycling or long-distance hiking. Wonder Woman was her usual awesome self. She never complained about the hours I spent walking or behind closed doors on my meditation pillow or with my nose stuck in a book.</p>\n<p>I continued some habits deep into 2019. It wasn't until August of that year that I broke the streak of 10,000-step days and closed activity rings. My arthritis flared up significantly in the spring. Between the uncaring attitude at my orthopedist's office and the weaponized incompetence and malevolence of my insurance provider, I dealt with untreated chronic pain for months while fighting to get the treatment I was entitled to. I ended up as depressed as I'd been in years, and bitter that creating the perfect set of habits hadn't made me immune to the black dog that has hounded me since my 20s.</p>\n<p>I'm all for anyone doing the things I did. I believe in the benefits of exercise, meditation and mental improvement. My experience is that none of those things are miraculous cures or preventatives for the slings and arrows that life can throw at you.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

I have studiously been assimilating useless knowledge since I was old enough to read. At a young age, I was a recognized expert on Bigfoot, the Loch Ness Monster and the Bermuda Triangle. I've written previously about my multiple readings of the <a href='https://linkage.lol/guinness-book-of-world-records/'>Guinness Book of World Records</a>.

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2025/img-8409.webp\" alt=\"IMG_8409\" /></p>\n<p>Aren't Saturday's amazing? I don't work on Saturdays. I get up whenever I want, usually early and spend my morning writing and doing the kind of tech chores I enjoy: curating photographs, adding entries to Day One Journal, perusing my saved articles on Pocket and via RSS and scrolling through the feeds of my favorite people on Mastodon and Bluesky.</p>\n<p>After a couple of hours of that this morning, Wonder Woman and I made a drive across town to pick up the only three of our grandchildren who live close by: 12-year-old Forrest, 10-year-old Harper and 7-year-old Tristen. Despite their age, we still collectively refer to them as \"The Babies.\" When we arrived, they came busting out the front door before our car even came to a complete stop. Obviously, all three of them were standing by the front window just waiting for us to get there. Their Mom came out to say goodbye and then the rest of us were off.</p>\n<p>The first stop was Zorba's, our neighborhood diner, which the kids call \"The Pancakes,\" after one of their favorite breakfast choices. Tristen is mostly just a little carnivore, though. When the waitress asked him what he wanted, he looked here in the eye and said \"Sausage.\" She asked if he wanted any grits or eggs to go with it. He thought for a minute and said, \"Bacon.\" That's what he got, too.</p>\n<p>We only live a couple of blocks away, so we were home immediately after we ate.Forrest teases me because my preferred perch on the couch is well-worn and obvious. All my electronic gear is on the table beside where I sit, along with coffee cups, screen wipes, and other items he relates to me. Every once in a while, he will jokingly try to climb into my spot, which generally prompts me to ask him if he's lost his mind.</p>\n<p>We all just hung out in the living room and talked for a few hours. They told us about school, their Dad's new puppy, and who had been mean to who lately. All of them aspire to be Internet superstars and content creators. Harper already has a private TikTok channel which is shared with just us and a couple of friends. She makes videos of herself doing random things. She disappeared for a while later in the day, and we all assumed she was off in another room making a video.</p>\n<p>In a couple of hours they were hungry again, wanting Mexican for lunch, which I was delighted to oblige. I have to work a little on Tristen's cultural sensitivity. Not only does he order chicken fingers and fries, he also complained today because the music was in Spanish and he couldn't understand it. He likes the Latino kids he goes to school with and can correctly use the Spanish pronunciation of their names, so I don't think he has ant budding MAGA tendencies, thank God.</p>\n<p>After lunch, we went to see Mufasa: the Lion King, as promised. You have to pass a huge candy store on the way to the theater's front door, and we did not even try to skip past it. We let them get a grab bag and put it in the car before the movie started. We still got popcorn too! The kids all tease me about my proclivity for frequent naps, which I take any time at any place. I didn't know that today they'd already told their Mom they thought I'd fall asleep in the theater with it's soft reclining seats. They were right, or course. Wonder Woman punched me so many times for snoring that my shoulder is sore.</p>\n<p>By the time the movie was over, they were ready to go back and see their Mom, who they all adore. We do too. As we pulled into their neighborhood, they pointed to houses for sale and suggested point-blank that we buy one of them because obviously, we want to live closer to them, right? Wonder Woman and I have only been back home for a couple of hours, and I am already looking forward to the next time we can go see The Babies again.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

That&#39;s where I found\ntoday&#39;s app.</p>\n\n<p>If you need a nice, simple , easy to use GUI front end for FFMpeg, , the\nfree offering from developer Justin Bush, <a\nhref=\"https://converter.revblaze.com/\">Video Converter - All-in-One\nVideo Conversion</a> is an easy to access choice, Available in the <a\nhref=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/video-converter/id1518836004,\">Mac\nApp Store</a> this app has a simple drag and drop interface.</p>\n\n<p>To use the app, first drop the video file to be converted into its\nholding area. The options are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Output formats</strong> are suitable for use on AirPlay, iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, Cast, Xbox, PlayStation, YouTube and web hosting<br />• MP4<br />• MKV<br />• M4V<br />• MOV<br />• WEBM<br />• AVI<br />• GIF</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Codecs</strong><br />• H.264<br />• H.265 (HEVC)<br />• MPEG-4<br />• VP8<br />• VP9<br />• Apple ProRes</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Quality</strong><br />• Auto (with transmuxing)<br />• Balanced<br />• Better Quality<br />• Smaller Size<br />• ProRes Profiles</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The app allows you to AirPlay your BluRay movie without sacrificing 4K\nquality or immersive Dolby Digital Surround Sound. It is capable of\nhandling up to 8K video. If you input a video file with 5.1 or 7.1\nsurround sound for your home theater system, your output video will\nretain that ultra-quality format.</p>\n\n<p>User reviews praise the app for its ease of use and speed on Apple\nSilicon, for which it is optimized.

That&#39;s where I found\ntoday&#39;s app.</p>\n\n<p>If you need a nice, simple , easy to use GUI front end for FFMpeg, , the\nfree offering from developer Justin Bush, <a\nhref=\"https://converter.revblaze.com/\">Video Converter - All-in-One\nVideo Conversion</a> is an easy to access choice, Available in the <a\nhref=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/video-converter/id1518836004,\">Mac\nApp Store</a> this app has a simple drag and drop interface.</p>\n\n<p>To use the app, first drop the video file to be converted into its\nholding area. The options are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Output formats</strong> are suitable for use on AirPlay, iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, Cast, Xbox, PlayStation, YouTube and web hosting<br />• MP4<br />• MKV<br />• M4V<br />• MOV<br />• WEBM<br />• AVI<br />• GIF</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Codecs</strong><br />• H.264<br />• H.265 (HEVC)<br />• MPEG-4<br />• VP8<br />• VP9<br />• Apple ProRes</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Quality</strong><br />• Auto (with transmuxing)<br />• Balanced<br />• Better Quality<br />• Smaller Size<br />• ProRes Profiles</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The app allows you to AirPlay your BluRay movie without sacrificing 4K\nquality or immersive Dolby Digital Surround Sound. It is capable of\nhandling up to 8K video. If you input a video file with 5.1 or 7.1\nsurround sound for your home theater system, your output video will\nretain that ultra-quality format.</p>\n\n<p>User reviews praise the app for its ease of use and speed on Apple\nSilicon, for which it is optimized. One reviewer noted that the app did\nnot carry over subtitles or chapter markers. It also doesn’t have any\nfeatures for upscaling.</p>\n\n<p>You can view the source code on <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/inter-ops/Converter\">GitHub</a>. The most\nrecent update was in November 2024. The app has been in development for\nthree years.</p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Video Converter - All-in-One Video Conversion' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2025/34-2.webp\" alt=\"Ashmont School\" />\n<strong>The Remains of Ashmont School Where My Mother Went in the 1950s</strong></p>\n<p>If you live in Europe, I'd like for you to read this post without laughing at me or immediately going on social media to mock me. I'm going to talk about old stuff. Yes, I know I live in the United States and that we don't really have any old man-made artifacts here. Many of you in Ireland, England and on the continent live in houses that would be museums and tourist attractions if they were transported here. I was in Leeds in the UK a few years back and my host stopped by <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirkstall_Abbey'>Kirkstall Abbey</a> on a whim and didn't make a big deal out of it. The place was built in 11152. It blew my mind, but to him, it was just a place on the edge of town.</p>\n<p>I live in North Carolina. The First Nations people who lived here when the first English settlers landed included the Cherokee, Tuscarora, Catawba, Lumbee, and various Siouxan tribes like the Occaneechi, Haliwa-Saponi, Waccamaw Siouan, Meherrin, and Coharie. We still have a sizable Native population. One county over from where I live, there are between 40K-50K members of the Lumbee tribe. There are ancient burial mounds in my county located near the Cape Fear River.</p>\n<p>There are no remnants of the state's most famous early settlers, known as the lost colony.  A group of 117 English men and women landed on Roanoke Island, a few miles inland from site where several hundred years later the world's first airplane flight would occur. All of these settlers disappeared in a three-year period when the organizers of the colony returned to England. Included in the missing was Virginia Dare, the first child of English descent born in the new world. Today, Roanoke Island is home to the community of Manteo, a nice place to visit on the way to the Outer Banks.</p>\n<p>We were one of the 13 colonies that declared independence from Great Britain in 1776. There are historical markers a few miles from my neighborhood where the British Army encamped on the way to get their asses handed to them at the Battle of Moore's Creek Bridge. I could walk to the spot where the state ratified the constitution from my driveway. Because of numerous fires through the years only a couple of pre-revolutionary buildings still exist in town, fittingly, the largest of them was a once a tavern.</p>\n<p>My paternal lineage, meaning my ancestors with the same last name that I have, came to the US around 1800. The first of us listed in a US census stated that his father's birthplace was France. I suspect he may have been the son of an English soldier, born to a camp follower. Whatever. I have no real way of knowing the exact story. What I do know that is we've been hanging around this same county now for 225 years.</p>\n<p>I am not one of those Southerners with any sort of positive attachment to my heritage connected to the Civil War. Numerous ancestors from all branches of my family were in the Confederate Army, some drafted, some volunteered. One died of disease before ever going into battle at a giant unsanitary recruitment center located on what is now the grounds of the veterinary school for NC State University. Another was wounded at the Battle of the Wilderness in Virginia. My favorite was an extremely reluctant soldier who served at three different times but only for very short periods. He kept trying to get out of it and come back home. Good for him.</p>\n<p>Another branch of the family were Quakers. They didn't participate in the economy of enslaved people, nor did they serve in the Army. They farmed and worked in cotton mills and generally minded their own business.</p>\n<p>For you Outlander fans, part of my family were Highland Scots who came here after the Battle of Culloden which ended the Jacobite rebellion in Scotland and placed it firmly under English rule. The family name is McFadyen and they were good Presbyterians who farmed the land on southeastern NC into the 20th century. One of them, my grandmother's brother died in Italy fighting Nazis during World War Two.</p>\n<p>Even though we are deep into the 21st century now, there are still signs of the past all around, if you know where to look. There are tobacco barns built from logs and chinked with mud on various farms. That type of tobacco production was last practiced in the 70s. I have hiked all the way through the NC mountains from our border with Georgia all the way to Virginia. Some of the trails today's hikers follow are the same routes Native Americans were using when we got here, I am always amazed when I am following a difficult mountain trail and I come to a stone fence or giant stone piles and I realize that at one time the thickly forested Appalachian mountainsides were clearcut and hardscrabble mountain folks planted crops there and plowed the fields with mules.</p>\n<p>I am not a flag waving patriot in the traditional sense. I am not proud to be from where I'm from. I'm not ashamed of it either. We all have a history and I just happen to know mine because I'm curious and sought the information. That information gives me a connection to the past I would not otherwise have.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

With clients for macOS, iOS, Windows, Android and Linux, you can\ncommunicate with just about anyone through a network of 2000\ndecentralized servers. If a server goes down, the network stays up,\neliminating any one node as a single source of failure.</p>\n\n<p>Session&#39;s encrypted messages are sent through an onion routing network.\nOnion networks encrypt messages with multiple layers of encryption, then\nsend them through a number of nodes. Each node ‘unwraps’ (decrypts) a\nlayer of encryption, meaning that no single node ever knows both the\ndestination and origin of the message. Session uses onion routing to\nensure that a server which receives a message never knows the IP address\nof the sender.</p>\n\n<p>Account in Session are created and secured with a mnemonic seed which\ncan be used to restore your existing Account ID to a new device. Your\ndisplay name can be anything you want it to be. Session does not collect\nany geolocation data, metadata, or any other data about the device or\nnetwork you are using. On your local device, Session allows you to\nencrypt your local Session database with a PIN code. With this feature\nturned on, your messages cannot be accessed without knowing your PIN\ncode. If the police or a thief have physical access to your device, they\nstill can&#39;t see your messages without your PIN.</p>\n\n<p>Voice and video messaging are current beta features in the app. In early\n2025, the back end technology for the app is transitioning to upgraded\ntechnology, using crypto-based engineering. Although there are no paid\nfeatures currently, <a href=\"https://session.foundation/\">the non-profit\nfoundation</a> behind the app says that it may implement some in the\nfuture, using cryptocurrency. They say the primary private messaging\nwill always be free.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/session-foundation\">See the Session GitHub\nsite.</a></p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Session - Free and Open-Source E2E Decentralized Cross Platform Messaging' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

With clients for macOS, iOS, Windows, Android and Linux, you can\ncommunicate with just about anyone through a network of 2000\ndecentralized servers. If a server goes down, the network stays up,\neliminating any one node as a single source of failure.</p>\n\n<p>Session&#39;s encrypted messages are sent through an onion routing network.\nOnion networks encrypt messages with multiple layers of encryption, then\nsend them through a number of nodes. Each node ‘unwraps’ (decrypts) a\nlayer of encryption, meaning that no single node ever knows both the\ndestination and origin of the message. Session uses onion routing to\nensure that a server which receives a message never knows the IP address\nof the sender.</p>\n\n<p>Account in Session are created and secured with a mnemonic seed which\ncan be used to restore your existing Account ID to a new device. Your\ndisplay name can be anything you want it to be. Session does not collect\nany geolocation data, metadata, or any other data about the device or\nnetwork you are using. On your local device, Session allows you to\nencrypt your local Session database with a PIN code. With this feature\nturned on, your messages cannot be accessed without knowing your PIN\ncode. If the police or a thief have physical access to your device, they\nstill can&#39;t see your messages without your PIN.</p>\n\n<p>Voice and video messaging are current beta features in the app. In early\n2025, the back end technology for the app is transitioning to upgraded\ntechnology, using crypto-based engineering. Although there are no paid\nfeatures currently, <a href=\"https://session.foundation/\">the non-profit\nfoundation</a> behind the app says that it may implement some in the\nfuture, using cryptocurrency. They say the primary private messaging\nwill always be free.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/session-foundation\">See the Session GitHub\nsite.</a></p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Session - Free and Open-Source E2E Decentralized Cross Platform Messaging' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

The line that resonates with me is \"What a drag it is getting old.\" For me, the drag is the physical part of aging, much more so than the accumulated years, which in themselves are kind of cool.</p>\n<p>Sports scientists estimate that men reach their physical peak somewhere between 26 and 30, That is so patently messed up because it means that you spend the majority of your life slowly deteriorating. In the major spectator sports, it's the rare athlete who can compete past the age of 40. This doesn't mean that you can't be active, though. In my twenties and thirties, my kids were young and I was trying to get established in my career. Sports and hobbies took a back seat. My most physically active year were my 40s.  I was 48 when I hiked the AT.</p>\n<p>Wonder Woman is 58 and still running ultramarathons. She's a bit of a mutant, though. We have a physical performance lab at the university where we work. They asked her to come in for a study a few years back. In her early fifties, she was tested as having a fitness level compatible to that of a college athlete in their early 20s.  During her first year competing in ultras, at age 52, she ran in and won races at the distances of 50K, 50 miles, 100K and 100 miles. Just for a lark, she ran one road marathon with no special training and placed in the top 10 among thousands of entrants. She also completed a 100-mile bike ride after only very light training over a couple of weekends.</p>\n<p>My parents were young when I was born, so even though I'm almost 60, I've still got both of them. My mom also has mutant genes, having walked all the way across Scotland in her early 70s and then completing the Camino de Santiago across Spain just a couple of years later. Dad enjoyed a little too much bourbon and Salem cigarettes for too many years to have maintained much fitness, and today walks with a cane.</p>\n<p>I feel like I'm kind of wearing out prematurely myself. After dealing with painful arthritis in both knees for years, a drag physically and psychologically, I had them replaced five years ago. Although ai still have my hair, it turned white within the last decade. Wonder Woman insists I need a hearing aid. At least, I think that's what she said. This year, I finally reached the point where I can't function without glasses. Throw in the other aggravations of male aging, like getting up to pee three or four times a night, and it's no wonder that the trope of grumpy old man seems to fit so well on some days.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, having lots of life experience is remarkable. I've lived in seven decades and seen 11 US presidents leave office. I'm in the oldest cohort of Generation X so I can be old without suffering the indignity of being a boomer. Not only that, but I've pumped regular gasoline, used a rotary dial phone and bought vinyl records not to be trendy but because there was no other choice. I saw VCRs and DVD players come and go. I had AOL dial up and a fiber connection to the Internet.</p>\n<p>I hope to last a few more years. I want to around when Wonder Woman retires. We're probably won't have any more grandchildren. Thirteen is plenty. In a few more years, though, great-grandchildren should start coming along. I definitely want to be here for that. I also would like to see America come to its senses before I'm gone because I bet Jimmy Carter was pissed having to live out his last months after the 2024 election. <BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

The information they could potentially use includes, but\nisn&#39;t limited to, financial records, political or social organizing\nrecords, medical records, blackmail material, passwords and personal\ncommunications.

With Picocrypt&#39;s simple UI,\nall you have to do is drag and drop your files, enter a password, and\nhit Encrypt. There is no need to set up a volume, as there is with other\ntools like Veracrypt.</p>\n\n<p>Installing Picocrypt is simple. Only download Picocrypt <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/Picocrypt/Picocrypt/releases/latest/download/Picocrypt.dmg\">from\nthe official site</a>,. Open the container, and drag Picocrypt to your\nApplications folder.

The output volume will indistinguishable from a stream of random bytes, and no one can prove it is a volume without the correct password.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Picocrypt also has Windows and Linux versions, meaning that the\nrecipient of the files does not have to have a Mac to decrypt the files,\njust the password. Picocrypt is also portable and does not require\ninstallation. It can be run from an external drive, such as a USB stick.</p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Picocrypt - Free and Open-Source File Encryption with Simple but Powerful Features' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

The list includes for-profit gangs, unscrupulous\ndevelopers, the world&#39;s largest social media companies and repressive\ngovernments. The information they could potentially use includes, but\nisn&#39;t limited to, financial records, political or social organizing\nrecords, medical records, blackmail material, passwords and personal\ncommunications. Those who seek to access your data have increasingly\nsophisticated methods of bypassing weak security.</p>\n\n<p>A small but powerful free and open-source utility, <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/Picocrypt/Picocrypt\">Picocrypt</a>, weighing in\nat only 3MB provides easy to use encryption that is powerful enough to\nwithstand attacks from government agencies. With Picocrypt&#39;s simple UI,\nall you have to do is drag and drop your files, enter a password, and\nhit Encrypt. There is no need to set up a volume, as there is with other\ntools like Veracrypt.</p>\n\n<p>Installing Picocrypt is simple. Only download Picocrypt <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/Picocrypt/Picocrypt/releases/latest/download/Picocrypt.dmg\">from\nthe official site</a>,. Open the container, and drag Picocrypt to your\nApplications folder. You may need to manually trust the app from a\nterminal and control-click on the app if macOS prevents you from opening\nit:</p>\n\n<pre>xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Picocrypt.app</pre>\n\n<h2>Features</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Uses extra Reed-Solomon parity bytes to protect from file corruption and bit rot</li>\n<li>Built in customizable password generator</li>\n<li>Comments  to store notes, information, and text along with the encrypted file</li>\n<li>Keyfiles, which can be generated and distributed to multiple people if there is joint ownership of information requiring more than one person to authenticate decryption</li>\n<li>Paranoid mode - a double encryption method suitable for government level or whistle-blower secrecy</li>\n<li>File chunking splits large encrypted files into multiple user selectable sized blocks</li>\n<li>Deniability allows encrypted files to appear without identifiable headers so that if they are intercepted, the bad actor in possession of them will have no way to prove what they are. The output volume will indistinguishable from a stream of random bytes, and no one can prove it is a volume without the correct password.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Picocrypt also has Windows and Linux versions, meaning that the\nrecipient of the files does not have to have a Mac to decrypt the files,\njust the password. Picocrypt is also portable and does not require\ninstallation. It can be run from an external drive, such as a USB stick.</p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Picocrypt - Free and Open-Source File Encryption with Simple but Powerful Features' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2025/47788.webp\" alt=\"Men Yelling\" /></p>\n<p>Since I became politically active in the 90s, I've dealt with some pretty harsh behavior from people who didn't like my views. I'm not just talking about conservatives, either. When I was organizing veterans and military families against the war in Iraq was the worst. I live beside the most populated military base in the United States and even though I'm a vet with two kids who also served, plenty of people were pissed about anyone here openly opposing the war machine. I got death threats in the mail, my car window was shot out in my driveway, and I got some nasty notes taped to my door at work. Other than that, I've just had to deal with the normal name-calling and harassment many lefties endure. Recently, someone added my name to three moderation lists on Bluesky, labeling me a MAGA troll, a porn spammer and accusing me of some sex thing that I was scared to look up.</p>\n<p>On the flip side, if you've never been involved in left politics, you have no idea how people on our side can be vicious to each other in stupid purity tests. I've been accused by people who I wanted to be allies with of being insufficiently supportive of Palestine, women, LGBT rights, the environment, the Iraqi resistance and more. The worst people weren't far-left folks, though. The ugliest, most mean-spirited comments I've ever dealt with came from Blue State liberals who think every person in the south is a MAGA loving moron. I've seen people from NY and California and other places literally celebrate natural disasters in NC, including Hurricane Helene last October. I've been told that if I was a real Democrat, that I would move and never talk to anyone from NC again. These superior types don't even realize we have a Democratic governor and AG or that the state GOP has had more than a dozen voter suppression and gerrymandering laws eventually overturned.</p>\n<p>I believe in accountability and responsibility. I don't accept unacceptable behavior from people who think that just a bit of fascism or racism is OK. I'm mad at the state of my country, and I feel like lashing out more than is probably healthy. I also know this stuff is complicated and the practical application of my political values and societies expectations are difficult to balance if I turn off the bravado for a minute.</p>\n<p>I fantasize about being able to act on the anger I feel about the political state we are in.  I'd like to be able to call out every person who has done anything to enable the hateful policies that (white) people are applauding. I would like to refuse to deal with people with backwards views on gender, race, and immigration status. If they want to take food away from hungry kids or medical care away from sick people, I would like to be able to write them out of my life loudly and publicly because they deserve it.</p>\n<p>But let's step back into reality for a minute.</p>\n<p>I live in one of the larger cities in North Carolina. It votes reliably blue, as do most of the cities of its size in the state. The surrounding rural areas are as red as can be, including the county that employed me for twenty years. Even here in town., many of the residents are former or retired military and most of the white ones are Republicans. If you tried to gauge elections by yard signs, the GOP would win every time. It is not an echo chamber in any way. Conservatives and liberals live and work side by side.</p>\n<p>I am very openly on the progressive side, with the appropriate bumper stickers and snide remarks about Republican policy every once in a while. I don't cross the line at work (anymore) but I walk right up to it. Always have. I try to let me fellow white people know that I am not in their club. I'm not the one you come to complain about diversity hiring or to whine about Joe Biden being responsible for egg prices. I will absolutely get loud when subjected to backwards behavior but correcting every non-woke opinion in others is not my life's mission.</p>\n<p>I have someone close to me who is lucky enough to live in Austin, TX. He worked for Samsung for 15 years. When the Tesla Gigafactory was built, which was before the company CEO bought Twitter and revealed himself to be a fascist, recruiters for the EV maker made him an attractive offer which he accepted. It was a great opportunity for someone with no degree to get a job in a green industry, making a sizable six-figure salary with stock options vesting in a few years and potential bonuses to offset the two kids he's single-handedly putting through school. He is 100% aware of the behavior of the man at the head of his company's food chain. He does not defend him.</p>\n<p>Most of the people in my family who stay informed about politics  and have an opinion, lean left, but both of my parents are Republicans, although Mom isn't a Trump voter. One of my Dad's bothers is also conservative, and he happens to be the person responsible for me reaching adulthood without going into the juvenile justice system or foster care. He's the only person in my family who goes to a multi-racial church. He's just constitutionally incapable of voting for a Democrat because we'll take away his hunting rifle…or something. It makes me sad.</p>\n<p>I'd like to boast about having come out of the womb with  a natural inclination towards perfect politics, but I didn't. I didn't develop any strong political feelings until I was almost 30. I voted for one of the worst Republicans in history when I was 19 out of pure ignorance. I even skipped a couple of elections. I believe I've done an adequate job in the past 30 years of achieving redemption with the help of committed activists and mentors and my own open mind. Someone had to educate me about the backwardness and ignorance I lived in on a whole list of topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unions</li>\n<li>Israel/Palestine</li>\n<li>US Military Policy</li>\n<li>Criminal justice</li>\n<li>White privilege</li>\n<li>Affirmative action</li>\n<li>LGBT rights</li>\n<li>Patriarchy</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'm not going to confess every sin I've ever committed against the values I hold today, but there were many, from the horrible use of inappropriate language to joining the army and working in a prison. It took what it took to get me where I am today, but, yeah, I wish I'd gotten here sooner and with less baggage. I am not a unique or special case. I know others who've had journeys similar to my own. We made the most of our leaning opportunities and came out better for it. We learned to forgive ourselves, and we didn't defend our former attitudes.</p>\n<p>This is not the paragraph where I am going to wrap everything up into a neat package and hand it to you so that you know what to do. I wish I knew. I know that as angry as I am, I also have to practice empathy, understanding, and forgiveness, or I'll just be a shitty excuse for a person. I also have to resist the urge to just get along with people and take the easier and softer way of ignoring things that need to be dealt with. It's a balancing act and a hard one. Just do the best you can and act from a loving place as much as possible,<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

It scours the web every\nhour to search for articles using my keywords. I have monitoring feeds\nto help me track my favorite software titles for news and tips/tricks.\nThe wizard that creates these feeds lets me decide whether I want to\nsearch entire articles or just titles. I can search the entire Internet\nor just sources from sites whose main RSS feed I follow. As with all\nfeeds on Inoreader, I can set up a highlighter for my search terms\n(Obsidian, Raycast, Keyboard Maestro, Micro.blog). I can filter out\nterms I definitely do not find interesting (Android, Apple Vision Pro,\nTrump). Finally, I can filter out duplicates and near duplicates so my\nfeed doesn&#39;t get inundated on dates when one of my keywords makes the\nnews, for example when updates to a certain title get released. It is\npossible to place all these keyword monitoring feeds into a folder and\nto view the output combined. I can even generate an OPML file with the\noutput to share with others!</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Newsletter Subscription Replacement</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Inoreader allows me to generate email addresses to use in\n<strong>subscribing to newsletters</strong>. That way, I get the benefit\nof their content without having my mailbox clogged up. Like every other\nfeed, these newsletters can be saved to OneDrive, Dropbox or Google\nDrive. I can export them to Pocket or ReadWise, Instapaper, Blogger,\nTelegram, Twitter, Facebook, Mastodon or a custom location.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Automation</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>If you highlight text in any RSS article or newsletter, you can use the\nhighlight to <strong>trigger an IFTTT applet</strong>. You can do the\nsame with any article you mark to read later. In fact, IFTTT has a dozen\ndifferent triggers for Inoreader and over 2000 services you can connect\nit to.

It scours the web every\nhour to search for articles using my keywords. I have monitoring feeds\nto help me track my favorite software titles for news and tips/tricks.\nThe wizard that creates these feeds lets me decide whether I want to\nsearch entire articles or just titles. I can search the entire Internet\nor just sources from sites whose main RSS feed I follow. As with all\nfeeds on Inoreader, I can set up a highlighter for my search terms\n(Obsidian, Raycast, Keyboard Maestro, Micro.blog). I can filter out\nterms I definitely do not find interesting (Android, Apple Vision Pro,\nTrump). Finally, I can filter out duplicates and near duplicates so my\nfeed doesn&#39;t get inundated on dates when one of my keywords makes the\nnews, for example when updates to a certain title get released. It is\npossible to place all these keyword monitoring feeds into a folder and\nto view the output combined. I can even generate an OPML file with the\noutput to share with others!</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Newsletter Subscription Replacement</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Inoreader allows me to generate email addresses to use in\n<strong>subscribing to newsletters</strong>. That way, I get the benefit\nof their content without having my mailbox clogged up. Like every other\nfeed, these newsletters can be saved to OneDrive, Dropbox or Google\nDrive. I can export them to Pocket or ReadWise, Instapaper, Blogger,\nTelegram, Twitter, Facebook, Mastodon or a custom location.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Automation</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>If you highlight text in any RSS article or newsletter, you can use the\nhighlight to <strong>trigger an IFTTT applet</strong>. You can do the\nsame with any article you mark to read later. In fact, IFTTT has a dozen\ndifferent triggers for Inoreader and over 2000 services you can connect\nit to.

Cinco de Mayo, right? Of course it's also the day Hush and I got married and the day we took our first steps on the Appalachian Trail. Busy much?</p>\n<p>We were at home this morning (at Midnight). A train ride brought the night took us to Union Station and after an interminable wait, another train deliver us to Harpers Ferry, WV. Within minutes we'd crossed the Potomac river and we were in Maryland. We hiked along the river and the old C&O Canal before diverting to the Harpers Ferry Hostel, we are camping tonight. Since we've not laid down since yesterday morning, I predict a pretty good nights sleep. </p>\n<p>I'll kill he urge to wax on rhapsodically about all of this. We are happy, excited, it's Spring and we are in love. Queue the music.</p>\n<h2 id=a-hrefhttpswwwtrailjournalscomjournalentry418231last-night-in-new-yorka><a href='https://www.trailjournals.com/journal/entry/418231'>Last Night in New York</a></h2><p>Tonight the white noise machine is set to bird calls and mountain waterfalls. After a delicious dinner of Stovetop Stuffing (minus the butter) and a peanut butter covered Clif Bar I treated myself to a wipe down with my trusty bandana by the aforementioned mountain waterfall. </p>\n<p>Lying in the shelter with Hush, Piper and Bright Side we are all trying to figure out  a plan for Tuesday. Hush and I are in desperate need of some quality down time but the choices are few. The trail towns are small with limited lodging</p>\n<h2 id=a-hrefhttpswwwtrailjournalscomjournalentry424090going-above-treelinea><a href='https://www.trailjournals.com/journal/entry/424090'>Going Above Treeline</a></h2><p>Today after a three-hour climb we went above tree line and stayed there for two and a half miles. We experienced the unforgettable sight of the barren 5,000 ft. peaks of Mount Lincoln and Mount Lafayette as we climbed the rock strewn ridge line  towards them. In gusting winds but under sunny skies we marveled at the 360 degree views of rock slides, small towns, ski resorts and amazingly, the small lake we'd hiked around yesterday. From that lake, we photographed the mountain where we now stood. In the distance we could see the ominous outline of Mount Washington, the tallest point in the Northeast. Amazingly, we could also see a few of the peaks of Southern Maine. </p>\n<p>Anyone who tries to get in big miles in the White Mountains is missing a lot. For one, the hiking here is so physically demanding that pushing it will break down all but the fittest. Secondly, blasting down the trail and ignoring the overlooks is something we all do some times. But if you do that here, you're missing more than just another view of trees from overhead. You're missing something special. </p>\n<p>I'm way too tired to write much more.</p>\n<h2 id=a-hrefhttpswwwtrailjournalscomjournalentry428145climbing-katahdina><a href='https://www.trailjournals.com/journal/entry/428145'>Climbing Katahdin</a></h2><p>Everyone at the thruhiker's campsite was up well before dawn. Hush and I were the first to head up the mountain. About two miles up the Dutchmen passed us as we took a break by the last spring below tree line. Those two are practically professional adventurers so we didn't feel bad to see them disappear. </p>\n<p>Katahdin has the capability to break your heart. No other mountain throws so much at you. There are sections that look impossible. In one place, pieces of broken (!) rebar stick out of a boulder at rude angles, pretending to be climbing aides. You can't use hiking poles because you must use your hands (and knees, butt, back and in one case my head) to leverage your way ever upward. Thankfully you can see the summit from nearly two miles down the mountain. Fueled by adrenaline, you don't feel much pain in that long third hour of climbing. </p>\n<p>We made it to the northern terminus of the AT at 9:30 AM. The Dutchmen took a few pictures for us as they drank the beer they packed to the top for the occasion. We started back down the 5.2 mile knee jarring descent, wishing we had gloves for the rocks. Three and a half hours later we were done.</p>\n<h2 id=a-hrefhttpswwwtrailjournalscomjournalentry433424the-trail-out-of-damascusa><a href='https://www.trailjournals.com/journal/entry/433424'>The Trail Out of Damascus</a></h2><p>Welcome to the Abingdon Gap Shelter, a few miles south of the Virginia line. No one is here tonight other than Hush and I. Entries in the log book repeatedly complain about the noisy shelter mice so i suppose we do have some company. All of our food is hanging from the home made mice proof food bag hangers. So are our packs. </p>\n<p>We're deep enough into the woods to hear nothing but nature, bird calls, wind in the trees, the buzz of flies and the whine of stinging noseeums. There's no creek here, just a spring at the bottom of the hill, the long steep hill. This shelter, like many in TN I'm told, has no privy, just lots of mysterious trails into the surrounding woods. </p>\n<p>We ate our standard dinners, tuna and peanut butter on (separate) tortillas, salty snacks (gluten free pretzels, Chili Cheese Fritos) and candy (Milk Duds and Whoppers). We had some hot tea as well. </p>\n<p>Since its our first night out, we went over our plans for the next few days. Thankfully there aren't any long days coming up. That's good. I'm tired, footsore and just don't have as much energy as usual. After a few mild days, ill be ready to do something crazy,</p>\n<h2 id=a-hrefhttpswwwtrailjournalscomjournalentry436664the-last-mountaina><a href='https://www.trailjournals.com/journal/entry/436664'>The Last Mountain</a></h2><p>We started hiking today at 6:15 AM. The last time we started that early was Maine. We managed to hike in the dark for well over an hour using our head lamps while still making decent time. The trail leading to Springer goes through several gaps but the tread way is good. We had a little extra motivation to make good time. </p>\n<p>After we passed the Hawk Mountain Shelter we stopped for our last creek water coffee break. We started seeing other hikers shortly after that. I told every person I saw that today was the last day of our through hike. I was a little excited. </p>\n<p>We had 14.5 miles knocked out by 1:15, putting us in the Springer trail head parking lot. We hung out, talking to other hikers, scoring consumable trail magic and trying to come to terms with it all. </p>\n<p>When my Uncle Fred and my Dad arrived we headed up Springer, where I got teary eyed only briefly. We were undefeated in our struggle to become thruhikers. We won. </p>\n<p> We took a bunch of pictures. I left a rock from Katahdin up there with a note asking someone to take it back to Maine if they happened to be going that way.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

Others are being constrained by cowardly and sycophantic media companies bowing down to MAGA.</p>\n<p>When I was in the third grade, my Mom got married to a newspaper reporter. For the next few years we moved all over the state as the chain he worked for kept promoting him from reporter, to city editor to editor in chief. I learned how much work goes into reporting the news as I watched my step dad work long hours at marathon city council meetings for the Gastonia Gazette. I learned how to keep stats at high school sporting events for the New Bern Sun Journal and how to develop film in the darkroom of the Harnett County News. Our family made a trip to Washington, DC once so he could attend a press conference President Ford held just for the NC press. The biggest story he ever worked on was the return of Robert Garwood, an American Marine captured in Vietnam in 1965. Garwood didn't return to the US until 1979. He was sent to Camp Lejeune adjacent to the city of Jacksonville, NC where lived. My step father covered his court martial where he was found not guilty of desertion, the solicitation of U.S. troops in the field to refuse to fight and to defect and of maltreatment</p>\n<p>When people criticize everyone involved in reporting the news of being untrustworthy, or sellouts or downright dishonest, I know better. Journalism can be a low paying, thankless job performed ny incredibly dedicated people.

Since then, I've periodically updated them as life has continued around me. Robb defines Slash pages as \"common pages you can add to your website, usually with a standard, root-level slug like <code>/now</code>, <code>/about</code>, or <code>/uses</code>. They tend to describe the individual behind the site and are distinguishing characteristics of the IndieWeb.\"</p>\n<p>Although some grumpy types rebel at the thought of having the same pages on their blog as others have, as is their God-given right, I happen to enjoy seeing how original different people can be as they riff on the same ideas, If you've created your own Slash pages, feel free to drop a link in the comments so others can check them out.</p>\n<h2 id=a-hrefhttpsamerpielolslashmy-slash-page-homea><a href='https://amerpie.lol/slash/'>My Slash Page Home</a></h2><p>Check out the links to the individual pages of you want to see the whole thing.

I've lost count of how many computers I've accessed them on. I have copies of digital photos I took using a Sony Mavica camera, which used a 3.5 inch floppy to save the images. All of those songs I downloaded using Napster during its brief moment in the sun, I have all of them too. In fact, I have multiple copies of all of those memories.  It's not hard to do and if you don't have a system, you should create one.</p>\n<h2 id=tips-for-saving-documents>Tips for Saving Documents</h2><p>The two best formats for saving text based documents are as plain text/Markdown or as PDFs. Microsoft Word might be ubiquitous, but the format changes and you are never guaranteed to be able to open old Word documents in new versions of the application and across platforms. Luckily, the ability to convert a Word document into a PDF is bulit right into macOS and Windows.</p>\n<p><a href='https://askalibrarian.csuohio.edu/faq/43438'>How I do convert a Microsoft Word document to PDF format? - Ask A Librarian</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://www.writingpursuits.com/use-plain-text/'>Use Plain Text to Future-Proof Your Writing | Writing Pursuits</a></p>\n<h2 id=tips-for-saving-photos>Tips for Saving Photos</h2><p>I have copies of my photos on an external hard drive and on three different cloud services. It's easy to set up a modern computer or phone to automatically save photos to multiple cloud services.

If you have bootlegs collected over the years, you want find that on commercial streaming services either. To make sure you keep a copy of those important tunes regardless of what happens to your computer, put a copy of them on an external drive and a cloud drive, like Dropbox, Google Drive or One Drive.

You can use Trakt in a browser, but It has an API that allows app\ndevelopers to incorporate the Trakt database into their products.\nRecently, Trakt got a significant new feature with the introduction of\nscrobbling, the automatic addition of shows watched to your personal\ndatabase from five of the largest streaming services:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Netflix</li>\n<li>Max</li>\n<li>Hulu</li>\n<li>Amazon Prime</li>\n<li>AppleTV+</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It also added scrobbling from several popular media centers and players,\nlike Plex, Kodi and VLC</p>\n\n<p>The features in the Trakt API and companion apps allow you to track what\nyou&#39;re watching, add to lists, discover, find where to watch (via a\npartnership with <a href=\"https://www.justwatch.com\">Just Watch</a>),\nsee what&#39;s up next and get recommendations. Trakt has a free tier and a\npro tier. I&#39;ve had a pro membership for a decade. It provides a lot of\nvalue, and I&#39;ve recommended it to everyone in my family. If you would\nlike a free one-month pro trial, <a\nhref=\"https://trakt.tv/vip/referral/5c16463843fa472fbed79ab239a3ed16\">use\nthis link.</a></p>\n\n<h2>Mac Apps</h2>\n\n<p>My current choice of apps for Trakt integration is <a\nhref=\"https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/sequel-entertainment-database\">Sequel\nEntertainment Database</a>, an app that also provides lists and tracking\nfor print and audiobooks as well as games. It is in iOS/iPadOS app that\nruns on Macs with Apple Silicon.

Escapist fantasies are the order of the day. We know the old saw is true,\"No matter where you go, there you are.\" There may not actually be a geographic cure for what ails us, but escapism and fantasy are what we have left. We are fully cognizant of the creeping oligarchy and fascist tendencies popping up all over the world, but we still want to get away.</p>\n<p>If you live in one of the places I mention, you can be a spoil sport and leave a comment detailing all the things wrong with my fantasy version of your homeland if you'd like to. I know I am dealing with an idealized creation of my own imagination. I am just wishful, not naive.</p>\n<h2 id=first-choice-new-zealand>First Choice - New Zealand</h2><p>This is about as far away as I can get from Mar-a-Lago. It's attractive because, like most of my fellow countrymen, I only speak one language and what do you know, it happens to be the same one they speak in New Zealand. If photos tell the truth, it is a drop-dead gorgeous country. Like the US, it has a famous and spectacular long distance hiking trail, the Te Araroa, 3,000 KM of rugged beauty. Another  positive factor about the culture there is that white people seem to have taken more responsibility for the historic injustices done to the Maori people than what we have. That's a big plus.</p>\n<h2 id=second-choice-ireland>Second Choice - Ireland</h2><p>I've actually been to the island of Ireland, but not the Republic. I was only able to visit Northern Ireland, the six counties that the UK still holds on to. Still, I know that the Irish Republic has a president who is a gay, half-Indian doctor. I'm giving the country a lot of credit for that. I'm also a fan of the way the Irish police themselves. They don't even call their law enforcement  folks \"the police.\" They are referred to as the Garda Síochána and they manage to keep the peace without being armed to the gills and shooting POC every 15 minutes. I don't have Irish heritage, so I hopefully won't annoy anyone with the typical American plastic paddy act. There are a lot of tech companies there, so I'd even be able to contribute to the economy.</p>\n<h2 id=third-choice-pitcairn-island>Third Choice - Pitcairn Island</h2><p>My ultimate Fantasy get away is the tiny British Island in the Pacific Ocean where the inhabitants are mostly descendants of nine <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_people' title='British people'>British</a> <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutiny_on_the_Bounty' title='Mutiny on the Bounty'><em>HMS Bounty</em> mutineers</a> and twelve <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahitians' title='Tahitians'>Tahitian</a> women. There are about 35 permanent inhabitants. Most of the people who live there are Seventh Day Adventists and while I am not religious, I am well acquainted with the Adventist Church. I like their emphasis on health and I appreciate the way they decided to ignore some of the changes other Christians made to their religion, like arbitrarily changing the day or worship just to make the pagans happy. I'd gladly hang out on a tiny island far away to escape MAGA for four years.</p>\n<p>It takes a lot to motivate me to want to leave North Carolina, my lifelong home. We are not looking forward to the continuation of the current timeline. I'm approaching this from a massively privileged position as a straight, white, male, middle-class veteran. My brothers and sisters who are POC, LBGT or poor face all kinds of discrimination, harassment and potentially the loss of health insurance, medical care and the removal of any social safety net. It is going to suck so bad.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

I use</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/PKM-er/obsidian-editing-toolbar\">The editing toolbar</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/lukeleppan/better-word-count\">Better word count</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/zuchka/obsidian-readability\">Reading lever indicator</a></li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/Clemens-E/obsidian-languagetool-plugin\">Language Tool,</a> a freemium grammar checker</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-url-into-selection\">Paste URL into selection</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>On iOS, however, I prefer to write using <a\nhref=\"https://getdrafts.com/\">Drafts</a>, also a plain text tool, but\none designed as a temporary holding spot until the text is moved to its\nfinal home. Drafts has <a href=\"https://actions.getdrafts.com/\">an\nonline directory</a> where you can find extensions that add to its\ncapabilities, making it useful with various apps, not just Obsidian. I\nuse it with <a href=\"https://actions.getdrafts.com/g/1aw\">Things 3</a>,\n<a href=\"https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/2S3\">Google</a>, <a\nhref=\"https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1EU\">Dropbox</a>, <a\nhref=\"https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1E1\">Google Drive,</a> <a\nhref=\"https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/2Gs\">Day One</a>, <a\nhref=\"https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1Fj\">Gmail</a> and <a\nhref=\"https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/2RB\">ChatGPT</a>. There are also\nextensions to<a href=\"https://actions.getdrafts.com/g/1Ce\"> format\nMarkdown</a> and for other text manipulation actions.</p>\n\n<p>My problem with Obsidian on iOS is that although the program now opens\nmuch quicker than it used to, it is slower than I&#39;d like to sync, even\nthough I am a paid Obsidian sync user. It&#39;s also prone to crashing and\nrestarting if I try to do certain things while it&#39;s syncing. Sometimes,\nif I&#39;ve started my daily note on my Mac and I if try to open it on my\nphone before the sync finishes, my existing content gets overwritten or\na duplicate file is created. To avoid creating content on the phone with\nObsidian. I just use it as reference tool.</p>\n\n<p>Both Obsidian and Drafts are universal apps. Anything you create on one\nhardware platform eventually becomes available on all platforms, Mac and\niOS. Here are my different use cases for Drafts with Obsidian.</p>\n\n<h2>Send to Obsidian <a href=\"https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1qB\">(link)</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>This action creates a new note in the inbox of my vault with the\ncontents of the Draft. I only use one vault, but if I used more than\none, I could use different versions of this Drafts extension to send\nnotes to different vaults.</p>\n\n<h2>Append to Daily Note <a href=\"https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/2EO\">(link)</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>If I have information in a Draft that I want to add to my daily note,\nthis extension appends the information to the bottom of the note\nverbatim.

I use</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/PKM-er/obsidian-editing-toolbar\">The editing toolbar</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/lukeleppan/better-word-count\">Better word count</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/zuchka/obsidian-readability\">Reading lever indicator</a></li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/Clemens-E/obsidian-languagetool-plugin\">Language Tool,</a> a freemium grammar checker</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-url-into-selection\">Paste URL into selection</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>On iOS, however, I prefer to write using <a\nhref=\"https://getdrafts.com/\">Drafts</a>, also a plain text tool, but\none designed as a temporary holding spot until the text is moved to its\nfinal home. Drafts has <a href=\"https://actions.getdrafts.com/\">an\nonline directory</a> where you can find extensions that add to its\ncapabilities, making it useful with various apps, not just Obsidian. I\nuse it with <a href=\"https://actions.getdrafts.com/g/1aw\">Things 3</a>,\n<a href=\"https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/2S3\">Google</a>, <a\nhref=\"https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1EU\">Dropbox</a>, <a\nhref=\"https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1E1\">Google Drive,</a> <a\nhref=\"https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/2Gs\">Day One</a>, <a\nhref=\"https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1Fj\">Gmail</a> and <a\nhref=\"https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/2RB\">ChatGPT</a>. There are also\nextensions to<a href=\"https://actions.getdrafts.com/g/1Ce\"> format\nMarkdown</a> and for other text manipulation actions.</p>\n\n<p>My problem with Obsidian on iOS is that although the program now opens\nmuch quicker than it used to, it is slower than I&#39;d like to sync, even\nthough I am a paid Obsidian sync user. It&#39;s also prone to crashing and\nrestarting if I try to do certain things while it&#39;s syncing. Sometimes,\nif I&#39;ve started my daily note on my Mac and I if try to open it on my\nphone before the sync finishes, my existing content gets overwritten or\na duplicate file is created. To avoid creating content on the phone with\nObsidian. I just use it as reference tool.</p>\n\n<p>Both Obsidian and Drafts are universal apps. Anything you create on one\nhardware platform eventually becomes available on all platforms, Mac and\niOS. Here are my different use cases for Drafts with Obsidian.</p>\n\n<h2>Send to Obsidian <a href=\"https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1qB\">(link)</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>This action creates a new note in the inbox of my vault with the\ncontents of the Draft. I only use one vault, but if I used more than\none, I could use different versions of this Drafts extension to send\nnotes to different vaults.</p>\n\n<h2>Append to Daily Note <a href=\"https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/2EO\">(link)</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>If I have information in a Draft that I want to add to my daily note,\nthis extension appends the information to the bottom of the note\nverbatim. It&#39;s best not to run the extension until after opening\nObsidian for iOS and letting it sync.</p>\n\n<h2>Append to Daily Note With Time and Place <a href=\"https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/2Fc\">(link)</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>This action adds a time stamp and the GPS coordinates to the text\nappended to the bottom of my Daily Note.

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2025/33-1.webp\" alt=\"2025-01-18 at 20\" /></p>\n<p>In polite company, independent thinking is frowned upon. The people in charge of an organization like to be the ones who define what things mean. Questioning or analyzing those definitions is frowned up. It's akin to insubordination. The larger the organization is, the more entrenched the official version of the truth becomes, and the sin of asking “why” can be considered radical or unpatriotic. Take the role of the US military, for example. You know you've heard that they \"fight for our freedom.\" After all, freedom isn't free, right?</p>\n<p>Now, tell me how exactly rice farmers from Vietnam threatened the freedom of the United States in the 60s and early 70s. How they threatened it so much that the US had to sacrifice the lives of 58,220 service members. The majority of them were draftees forced to fight under penalty of law. Or, tell me how Iraq threatened our freedom because 19 Saudi Arabians flew planes into buildings in the US. If you ask those questions out loud, you are going to get labeled. If you teach US history in a public school, you will get fired. The safest thing to do is accept the narrative and wave the flag.</p>\n<p>There is a sizable portion of white people in the US who believe we don't need programs to encourage diversity, equity, and inclusion. They believe racism is a thing of the past, that there is no need for the voting rights act and that Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. himself would be against affirmative action. They believe this in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary. In my home state of North Carolina, as soon as part of the voting rights act was overturned by Supreme Court conservatives, the Republican Party crafted a bill. That bill, said the judge who overturned it, <a href='https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/court-north-carolina-voter-id-law-targeted-black-voters/'>was designed with surgical precision</a> to keep as many black people from voting as possible.</p>\n<p>We should know, given quantifiable numbers like the achievement gap in public schools, the pay gap between white workers and their non-white counterparts and the incarceration rates for different races, all of which favor white people, harming everyone else, that a problem exists. Unfortunately, most white people, as indicated by the way they vote, believe the issue isn't racism, but that POC are...what? Well, they won't come out and say it unless they know you are a member of their club, but obviously, they think the issue is inferiority, laziness and entitlement. The fault doesn't lie with the in-group who've run this country for over 400 years. It lies with the people who only got something close to equal rights in my lifetime.</p>\n<p>Once again, don't go into the company of powerful people, particularly white ones, and point out the obviousness of systemic racism. They have a label for that, “identity politics.” When you think independently of the narrative that people are comfortable with, you make them uncomfortable and based on my experience, that is a grave sin. It's certainly not polite. It's \"discussing politics.\" It's frowned upon. Furthermore, it will get you fired. They'll say it was because of something else, but in the end, speaking truth to power is risky business.</p>\n<p>Of course, today's majority reserves a spectacularly evil brand of groupthink to demonize their favorite victims, the people in the LGBT community. It's not a new community. They've been with us for all of recorded history, but only in the past few years have they come close to having the rights they deserve. There is no logic in denying them rights. In fact, society harms itself by persecuting them. One of the greatest minds of the 20th century, Alan Turing, credited with saving 20 million lives in World War Two by cracking Nazi codes that gave the allies the information they needed to defeat Germany, died by suicide. He was chemically castrated by the British government for being homosexual. If you are capable of thinking independently of  popular opinion, you see bullshit for what it is.</p>\n<p>To be anti-war, anti-racist and anti-hate you have to ask questions that make people uncomfortable because humanity in the 21st century is so warped that being  a war - loving hate filled bigot is normal and opposing it is radical.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

Additionally, the end of fact checking on the largest social media sites portends a future where the truth is undervalued.<a href='https://www.newsweek.com/elon-musk-takes-aim-wikipedia-fund-raising-editing-political-woke-2005742'>Elon Musk</a> and the <a href='https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/9/2296068/-Heritage-Foundation-goes-after-Wikipedia'>Heritage Foundation</a> are attacking Wikipedia and even individual contributors. If you have the disk space, I encourage you to <a href='https://www.instructables.com/Download-Wikipedia-for-Offline-Use/'>download the entire Wikipedia archive</a> before the right wing destroys it.</p>\n<p><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Hampton'>One of the articles I'm afraid of losing to the fascists</a> is about Fred Hampton, a 21-year old African-American organizer from Chicago who was assassinated in his bed by the Chicago Police Department, who fired more than 100 unanswered shots into the apartment where Hampton and other so called radicals were sleeping. The police were photographed grinning as they brought his bullet riddled body out to the street.</p>\n<p>The raid was encouraged by J. Edgar Hoover, the FBI director who feared that Hampton was so intelligent, so charismatic and such a natural leader that he was capable of organizing a multi-racial movement to overthrow the government of the United States. Remember, this was a 21-year old man.  In a 1982 trial, Hampton's family sued the Chicago PD and the FBI. They won the equivalent of a multi-million dollar judgment. It was revealed during the trial from COINTELPRO documents and other sources that Hampton's death at the hands of the police department was a planned assassination at the urging of the FBI.</p>\n<p>Fred Hampton considered <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism' title='Fascism'>fascism</a> the greatest threat, saying \"nothing is more important than stopping fascism, because fascism will stop us all.\" This is as true in 2025 as it was in 1969. It was revealed this week that the first mass roundup of undocumented immigrants is scheduled to happen the day after Trump in inaugurated. The location is Chicago.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2025/100-1562-resized.webp\" alt=\"My_Kids\" /></p>\n<p>When playing the old parlor game, \"Would You Change Anything If You Could Live Life Over,\" I always emphatically stress that I like the way my life is now, so I wouldn't change a thing. I fear the butterfly effect might get me. It could  cause me to miss meeting Wonder Woman or have me choose a career in some other field that I might have loved less than the mostly great time I've had working in technology. That's a pretty boring answer when you are trying to kill time on a camping trip or a long car ride, so for the sake of not being a killjoy, I'll come up with a few \"maybes\".</p>\n<h2 id=that-one-time-i-voted-for-a-republican>That one time I voted for a Republican</h2><p>When I lived with my Mom and step-dad in the early to mid-70s, politics was discussed with some frequency, mostly registering disgust with Richard Nixon and NC senator Jess Helms. During my freshman years of high school, I moved to my uncle's farm. Politics was never discussed there — ever. We discussed the likelihood of rain, who shot J.R on Dallas and what time the next football game was coming on.  I turned 18 in 1983 and the following year I was eligible to vote in the election. I'd joined the military, and although I read the paper, I still didn't have strong political feelings, so when I went to the polls, I cast my ballot carelessly. When I finally did get some political sensibility, I wanted a time machine ride to go recast that vote, but it was too late.</p>\n<h2 id=the-time-i-married-a-woman-i-met-in-rehab>The time I married a woman I met in rehab</h2><p>I was never a successful drinker. The first time I tried to quit, I was 22. I'd been convicted of drinking and driving and to keep my job working for the state, I volunteered to go to rehab (at a place that is now a funeral home.) While I was there, I met a woman ten years older than me who was also in treatment. She liked me, and I liked being liked. I moved in with her after spending a single weekend together. Look, this woman was so evil, that when we were together, we refinanced our house. She was a legal secretary and did all the paperwork. When we inevitably split up, I found out that while I had signed the mortgage and was responsible for the loan, she'd left my name off the deed to the house. I had no leverage to make her take my name off the mortgage. My name stayed on it for over 20 years — until the bank finally foreclosed and gave me a big old frowny face on my credit report.</p>\n<h2 id=school-stuff>School Stuff</h2><p>Although my mother probably is still holding on to hope, I never went to college. I never wanted to, and I'm not sorry one bit that I didn't. That is my story, and I am sticking to it. For the sake of contributing to the conversation though, I suppose if I had to pick a major, with the benefit of hindsight, I'd have probably gone with journalism. It's a low paying job with long hours. The people who practice it get little respect. Still, I've always loved writing. Crafting informative, well-researched blog posts on subjects I'm passionate about takes me to my happy place. I did work as a technical writer and editor for a few years at the same time my brother and sister, both graduates of our state's flagship university, were doing the same thing. Funny how life works.</p>\n<h2 id=dad-stuff>Dad Stuff</h2><p>I raised three kids. I'll spare you the details because it gets confusing, but if you really want to put the puzzle together, read <a href='https://louplummer.lol/the-fourth-time-is-a-charm/'>The Fourth Time is a Charm.</a> The kids were all different, as people tend to be. My parents were 17 when I was born. I was 18 when my son was born. My daughter came along less than two years later. Being a teenage parent didn't ruin anyone's life. I wouldn't change that. What I would change is the number of parent-teacher conferences I went to, the number of soccer games and swimming practices attended and things like that. I wish I'd said “maybe” a lot less to them and “yes” a lot more. My youngest daughter, who I raised from age six into adulthood and I have had a difficult time lately. Her mom died of cancer three years after we were divorced, and it has been hard for her. There is no guidebook for complicated relationships like ours. I don't know exactly what I would do differently with her, if given the chance, but I'd come up with something.</p>\n<p>So there you have it. Those are my biggest regrets. None of them are the cause of lifelong trauma. Hopefully, I've made up for that errant vote. I'll count that unfortunate marriage as just practice. I live a comfortable life and I get to write all I want these days, so missing school didn't hurt. The great relationships I have with my two oldest kids and Wonder Woman's two daughters are a true source of happiness. The rocky time with my youngest still has time to heal.\nThanks for reading.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2025/truck.webp\" alt=\"truck\" /></p>\n<p>I used to drive for hours a day. My office was 30 miles from my home, much of it over two-lane country roads teeming with school buses. The first year I had that job, I drove through Ft. Bragg but that came to a sudden and scary stop on September 11, 2001. During the day, I often traveled between schools spread out over the large rural county that employed me. I spent a lot of time listening to audiobooks and podcasts. I was once a big NPR fan, but they had a habit of playing clips of Mitch McConnell speaking and by 2008, I couldn't take his voice anymore.  Finally, the Obama stimulus package from his first term kicked in and a good portion of my commute happened on multi-lane limited access roads.</p>\n<p>I was a farm kid. I learned to drive in a 1976 Ford Ranger pickup on a hog farm in Johnston County, NC. By the time I took driver's education in high school, I could operate several kinds of tractors, including a vintage International Farmall and an even older Allis Chalmers. We had  flatbed truck from the fifties named Spot and other vehicles in which we always left the keys. The actual  acquisition of my state issued driver's license was delayed by my first run-in with the legal system. I got arrested for drunk driving when I was 15, BEFORE I had a license. That should have been a sign that I wasn't cut out for a relationship with Demon Rum.</p>\n<p>In the Army I got to drive lots of things I only dreamed of as a kid. I've driven several different kinds of armored personnel carriers, an M1 tank, a Bradley fighting vehicle and the classic Army Jeep (we called the \"Quarter Tons\") that were replaced by HUMVEEs by the time my service ended.</p>\n<p>The loneliest time of my life was when my first marriage split up. My ex moved from NC to PA with our two children. It was an almost 900-mile round trip that I drove on as many weekends as I could manage in a stick-shift Nissan Sentra with no radio and no AC. I couldn't afford to stop and eat along the way and I often made the drive on Friday night after working the whole day. Traveling on Interstate 95 still brings back those memories. After just a few years, the kids came to live with me and I didn't have to make that horrible lonely trip any more.</p>\n<p>After that, the longest drive we made was when I'd take them to see their Nana, my mom, who lives at the coast. We made the trip in a variety of cheap cars over the years ranging from a $500 Chevette to Dodge Caravan I bought with a loan at 18% interest. My youngest was prone to car sickness and we would cheerfully point out to her all the spots where we had to stop for her to get sick over the years. Mom still lives in the same town today and I'm traveling the same roads to see, but Wonder Woman took over the driving a few years ago, so I have it easy now in the passenger where I might occasionally sneak a nap. Fortunately, I don't have to drive disposable cars any more either.</p>\n<p>When I go visit my dad, who lives in the next county, I will sometimes accompany him when he takes my step-mother for her daily ride. She has severe memory issues and only gets pleasure from a few things anymore. One of them is riding slowly through the farm country and watching the cycle of the crops grown in our area: cotton, tobacco. corn, soybeans and grain. Occasionally someone will get a wild hair and plant sweet potatoes or peanuts or best of all, a huge field of sunflowers. She announces that it's time for her ride, by picking up her purse and standing in front of Dad, who always just gets his keys and heads with her towards their car. If I'm there, I climb in the back seat and go along.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

This is not something I do. Hardly ever. Unless someone really needs correcting. Or I'm grouchy. But only then. For one thing, I simply do not have the emotional energy to argue with anyone over anything, on or off the Internet on most days. I don't know if you've noticed, but being alive in 2025 is exhausting. Come January 20th, it will be even more so.</p>\n<p>I conducted this search today strictly for the lolz. I wanted to see if anyone could seriously write an article to answer this question in a studied, calm and professional manner. If I was a reporter who caught an assignment to write a serious article about how to fight with a computer, I would quit on the spot because I have worked for crazy people before, and I did not like it.</p>\n<p>Of course, I did find such an article, and I am including it here for you to marvel at.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.wikihow.com/Win-an-Argument-Online'>How to Win an Argument Online: 7 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow</a></p>\n<p>I found a much better Reddit thread on the always helpful sub, r/UnethicalProLifeTips containing the kind of help I was envisioning. It advises you to misstate facts when arguing so that your opponent feels obligated to correct you. Let's say you are disputing what level of hell Donald Trump will be assigned to when the syphilis finally kills him. You should mention something about his 36 felony convictions so that the MAGAt you're fighting with has to say, \"That's a lie. HE only had 34 felony convictions!\"</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/UnethicalLifeProTips/comments/8lz3m6/ulpt_if_you_want_to_win_an_internet_argument/'>Unethical Pro Life Tip - if you want to win an Internet argument, counter with facts that are slightly off. That way the other person can't correct you without advancing your argument. : r/UnethicalLifeProTips</a></p>\n<p>I can tell the person who wrote this article is a truly experienced Internet debater because they correctly cited Rule Number Four</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2025/43-1.webp\" alt=\"2025-01-16 at 18\" /></p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>AT SOME POINT IN TIME, CLAIM THE OTHER PERSON IS A NAZI. Every, and I repeat EVERY Internet argument should involve at least one comparison to either Hitler or the Nazis. This is one of the most basic requirements of an average Internet debate, and although ignorant outsiders may find it silly to compare a person arguing on the Internet with an individual responsible for the execution of millions, this action represents one of the most traditional pillars of every online debate</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href='https://www.somethingawful.com/news/how-win-any/'>How to Win Any Argument On the Internet</a></p>\n<p>The final puzzle piece discovered in my research, has an easy to follow 10 point plan</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You don’t have to be right. You just have to make your opponent feel like they’ve lost.</li>\n<li>Never argue with an eloquent debater.</li>\n<li>Never argue in a room where the crowd is already dead set against you, and is allowed to be as loud as they want to be, and whenever they want to be.</li>\n<li>Never argue with someone who’s a certified expert on the topic you’re about to argue about.</li>\n<li>Never argue with someone who is knowledgeable but never gets flustered.</li>\n<li>When trying to appeal to a crowd. Don’t worry about the facts. Appeal to their basest emotions, and their deepest fears. Remember, it’s not a lie if it’s 20% true.</li>\n<li>Make the crowd chuckle at your opponent. Make sure the crowd doesn’t perceive your opponent as a human being with feelings, care, and emotions.</li>\n<li>If you get the slightest of feeling you are being attacked by your opponent for whatever reasons. Make sure you make personal attacks that sound like zingers even though they have absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with the current argument. But you have to use this as a tactical weapon to divert from the topic of discussion. And not overdo it, or seem desperate when you do it.</li>\n<li>Don’t ever allow your opponent to get inside your skin. You might be losing your shit inside. But you have to be absolutely calm on the exterior.</li>\n<li>If they catch you in a lie. Use false equivalence. Use it as often as you can.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href='https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-win-an-argument-online'>How to win an argument online - Quora</a>\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

The review is below.\nI recently had a chance to put the paid version of the data recovery\ntools to work in a real-world situation. I was presented with a 2TB NTFS\nformatted drive that would mount on my Mac, but displayed the message\n&quot;Drive not available&quot; and showed no files structure in the Finder. The\ndrive belonged to a relative who lost access to her cloud account when\nswitching jobs and ended up with only one copy of her files from a\n20-year career - on a bad drive.</p>\n\n<p>Disk Drill scanned the drive, and it was able to see files on it. It\nwanted me to make a byte for byte copy, but I didn&#39;t have another 2TB\ndrive on hand. I had two 1TB hard drives and a dual drive bay, though. I\nused the Mac disk utility to combine the two physical drives into one\nlogical drive and tried to initiate the copy again, but still got a\nmessage that the drive was too small. Since I knew that there was less\nthan 100 GB of actual data on the drive, I was able to adjust the size\nof the number of bytes to be copied and the backup started. Although\ndata seemed to be moving quickly, the progress indicator said the backup\nwould take 28 hours. Ain&#39;t nobody got time for that.</p>\n\n<p>Rather than doing a byte for byte copy, which also includes unused\nspace, I elected to Disk Drill&#39;s recovery option instead. I initiated it\nand began to copy files, sometimes quickly and at other times seeming to\nstop. I got messages about the disk having physical damage, but the\nprogram never quit. After about 90 minutes, I had 86K files recovered.</p>\n\n<p>I did not have to pay the full retail price to use the recovery tools\nbecause the app is available as part of <a\nhref=\"https://go.setapp.com/invite/kmjmclw4\">Setapp</a>, a $10 a month\nsubscription that gives you unlimited access to hundreds of software\ntitles.</p>\n\n<h2>Original Review </h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cleverfiles.com/\">Disk Drill 5 by Cleverfiles</a>\nis marketed as data recovery software to retrieve lost files from\ninternal and external drive media as well as iPhone, iPad and Android\nstorage.

The review is below.\nI recently had a chance to put the paid version of the data recovery\ntools to work in a real-world situation. I was presented with a 2TB NTFS\nformatted drive that would mount on my Mac, but displayed the message\n&quot;Drive not available&quot; and showed no files structure in the Finder. The\ndrive belonged to a relative who lost access to her cloud account when\nswitching jobs and ended up with only one copy of her files from a\n20-year career - on a bad drive.</p>\n\n<p>Disk Drill scanned the drive, and it was able to see files on it. It\nwanted me to make a byte for byte copy, but I didn&#39;t have another 2TB\ndrive on hand. I had two 1TB hard drives and a dual drive bay, though. I\nused the Mac disk utility to combine the two physical drives into one\nlogical drive and tried to initiate the copy again, but still got a\nmessage that the drive was too small. Since I knew that there was less\nthan 100 GB of actual data on the drive, I was able to adjust the size\nof the number of bytes to be copied and the backup started. Although\ndata seemed to be moving quickly, the progress indicator said the backup\nwould take 28 hours. Ain&#39;t nobody got time for that.</p>\n\n<p>Rather than doing a byte for byte copy, which also includes unused\nspace, I elected to Disk Drill&#39;s recovery option instead. I initiated it\nand began to copy files, sometimes quickly and at other times seeming to\nstop. I got messages about the disk having physical damage, but the\nprogram never quit. After about 90 minutes, I had 86K files recovered.</p>\n\n<p>I did not have to pay the full retail price to use the recovery tools\nbecause the app is available as part of <a\nhref=\"https://go.setapp.com/invite/kmjmclw4\">Setapp</a>, a $10 a month\nsubscription that gives you unlimited access to hundreds of software\ntitles.</p>\n\n<h2>Original Review </h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cleverfiles.com/\">Disk Drill 5 by Cleverfiles</a>\nis marketed as data recovery software to retrieve lost files from\ninternal and external drive media as well as iPhone, iPad and Android\nstorage.

The sun is partially visible just above the horizon, casting a warm glow on the scene.  There is also a fence visible in the foreground, adding a sense of depth and perspective to the image.

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2025/plummer-kids.webp\" alt=\"plummer kids\" />\n<strong>Me, my sister and my brother</strong></p>\n<p>Last week my sister sent messaged me about a failed drive from which she needed some files recovered. She is pretty savvy with computers. She's pretty savvy with most things. Not only that, but she has never used me for free tech support, so I knew this had to be important. She explained that twenty years worth of files from her career as a Methodist pastor were on the drive, her \"whole life\" as she put it. I told her she could send me the drive, and I'd see what I could do. I didn't lecture her about backups or anything like that.</p>\n<p>Over the years, I've been approached by more than one crying person holding a USB drive or a laptop. I've seen people lose the only copy of their not yet submitted master's thesis, the only copy of their wedding video and twenty years worth of lesson plans by one unfortunate middle school teacher. Sometimes I've been able to rescue files but more frequently, despite my best efforts, I haven't been able to help people who have asked, despite badly wanting to.</p>\n<p>My sister's drive arrived by mail tonight. It was a 2TB Western Digital external hard drive with a USB3 connector. I added an adaptor and plugged it into my laptop, and it mounted immediately, a good sign. It was formatted with an NTFS (Windows) file system. Unfortunately, instead of showing me the file system, I just got a message that said, \"Drive Not Available.\" That was not a good sign.</p>\n<p>The data recovery application I own is called <a href='https://www.disk-drill.com'>Disk Drill.</a> I'm a Mac user, but the company that makes it also has a Windows version. Disk Drill scanned the drive, and it was able to see files on it. It wanted me to make a byte for byte copy, but I didn't have another 2TB drive on hand. I had two 1TB hard drives and a dual drive bay, though. I used the Mac disk utility to combine the two physical drives into one logical drive and tried to initiate the copy again, but still got a message that the drive was too small. Since I knew that there was less than 100 GB of actual data on the drive, I was able to adjust the size of the number of bytes to be copied and the backup started. Although data seemed to be moving quickly, the progress indicator said the backup would take 28 hours. Ain't nobody got time for that.</p>\n<p>Rather than doing a byte for byte copy, which also includes empty space, I elected to Disk Drill's recovery option instead. I initiated it and began to copy files, sometimes quickly and at other times seeming to stop. I got messages about the disk having physical damage, but the program never quit. After about 90 minutes, I had  86K files recovered.</p>\n<p>I called my sister and asked her to identify the most critical files and folders so that we could see if they were among the rescued files. They were. She lives just over 100 miles from me, so we agreed that I would begin to upload the data to my Google Drive and that I'd send her a link when it was done. As gently as humanly possible, I suggested that she start keeping two copies of her files. She explained to me that the situation was complicated.</p>\n<p>In the process of being assigned a new church, she discovered that her laptop, which is indeed hers and not the property of her employer, had been set up by the tech folks at the church she was leaving to use their One Drive. She had not been aware of that and didn't discover it until she went to look for her personal files and discovered they weren't available through the user profile she now had access to. She got temporary access to the old account and copied her files onto her external drive and then deleted them. And then, of course, the drive failed.</p>\n<p>That's where I entered the story, a story that looks like it is going to have a happy ending. My sister has done a lot for me and my kids over the years. Being able to do this for her is just me repaying some of the karmic debt I've incurred. Always celebrate your victories, like I'm celebrating this one.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

Just remember, both of these services are syncing services.\nThat&#39;s different from a backup. If you delete photos from either app,\nusing the wrong procedure, they will stay in your trash for a period of\ntime, but then they will be gone forever.</p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Using Google Photos on iOS Makes Leaving Meta Easier' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2025/07-1.webp\" alt=\"Rube\" /></p>\n<p>Here at the tail end of a career where I've spent at least some portion of my time providing technical support to the end users of technology in industry, education, medicine, insurance and banking, there isn't much I haven't seen. That includes devious middle school kids getting around security protocols designed by the brightest minds at Apple. It also includes people with multiple advanced degrees who can't read instructions on a screen that tell them to click a button labeled \"Next.\"</p>\n<p>I was around when Internet connectivity was introduced to the workplace. I worked with truly lovely and talented teachers at the tale end of long careers who valiantly tried to switch from paper grade books to buggy DOS-based student information systems. They would apologize when asking for help and just about always use the phrase \"I am not a computer person.\" I'd say \"That's OK, I don't know how to teach kindergarten.\" Some learned faster than others. Some, sadly, never learned and retired.</p>\n<p>OK, that was a quarter of a century ago. I don't have that attitude any more. According to Consumer Affairs, <a href='https://www.consumeraffairs.com/cell_phones/cell-phone-statistics.html'>91% of adults in the US have a smart phone</a> - which is a hand held computer with an operating system. Computer skills are taught in public schools. Most universities require students to have a laptop. Desktops and laptops have been ubiquitous in business for many years. And yet, and yet - I still get hit with \"I'm not a computer person.\"</p>\n<p>Somehow, the decision makers in many workplaces have decided that demonstrating competency with one of the basic tools of a job isn't a requirement. They hire people like me to hold the hands of their employees, enabling them to forego skill development because they can just call IT when they can't find a file they were working on yesterday or they've forgotten their password for the third time this month or they can't figure out how to make PDFs open in Adobe Reader.</p>\n<p>We require our employees to figure out how to get to work. When automotive technology changes, we don't hold their hand to show them how to plug in an EV. People buy Smart TVs every day, and they figure out how to watch Monday Night Football. Most of my fellow grandparent types manage to get Candy Crush installed.</p>\n<p>It absolutely blows my mind how many people using Windows  don't know how to find apps by clicking on the start button. I've spent over 30 years being told by IT managers to put the icons for MS Office and the installed browsers on every user's desktop. I don't expect people to use a hex editor or anything, but come on, why do we work from an expectation that people are stupid? Why isn't learning to use a password manager a basic skill? There's a sizable population who truly refuses to use self-service password resets. If they can't call the help desk to get their password reset, they just sit there, not working. WTF?</p>\n<p>I've probably written a version of this post four or five times before. I'll finally retire soon enough and then I won't worry about it anymore. It will be someone else's turn.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

He thought it was the greatest thing since sliced bread and wanted all the technical people in the IT department to take it immediately. I was on vacation because my grandson was visiting from out of state. The boss practically begged me to come in to work anyway for an afternoon to take the test. I acquiesced, against my better judgement, and humored him. After we all took the test, and they were evaluated, all hell broke loose. My departmental nemesis and I got the same assessment, and she was not having it. She was furious. I thought it was funny. I've tried unsuccessfully to find the results from that day. I wish I could tell you. If you're interested, you can take it yourself for free.</p>\n<p>I'd love to hear anyone's experience with life after this assessment. Did you find it helpful? Did you agree with it? Did my boss violate my privacy?</p>\n<p>One other bit of personal experience - when I was a correctional officer, I worked for a time in an in-processing center where we admitted inmates from jail.

In my experience, they are difficult to predict and arrive suddenly. Jobs, marriages, friendships, passions are all here until they are not. Buddhists believe that everything is disintegrating from the moment it is created. So do I. Permanence is an illusion. Thinking back on the giants I've known and how I could not conceive of a world without them and now what do I have? I have a world without them.</p>\n<p>I am not implying that my wife or your is going to leave either of us tomorrow, although you never know what's going to happen tomorrow. Because all rules have exceptions, there are cases where things apparently haven't changed over the course of my lifetime. No matter what I've done, and I have certainly done much, my dear Mom has always been there. Always. Always. Always.</p>\n<p>Within one month's time, I went from a child walking in a line to the lunchroom, raising my hand when I wanted to speak and asking permission to use the bathroom to being handed a rifle and shooting at human silhouettes representing the enemies of my country. Childhood ended abruptly at the gates of Ft. Benning. More than once, I had a job when I woke up and didn't have one when I went to sleep. It could happen again tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Any reunion worth its salt will have a table with pictures of those who could not be there to celebrate. Because they died. In fact they start dying immediately, and they just keep on doing it. The rest of us keep getting up and going to work until we join them and someone puts our picture in the table at the next reunion.</p>\n<p>I have a point.</p>\n<p>I'm getting to it.</p>\n<p>Just live. Do your job and try not to love it or hate it too much. It's just a job. Love your wife today. Don't wait for things to get better or different before you're ready to put in that extra effort. Friendships can wither if you don't water them, so fill up your bucket and make some phone calls or get in your car and go see someone. If you have a passion, and god I hope you do because that's what makes life worth living, then act on it today. Ride your bike, write in your journal, get out your camera, go to the gym. Do it today. It's all you have.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

When you hear the same types of events reported for the hundredth time though, it's hard to attach any emotion to it. Most people who use social media are at least peripherally aware that the big companies that own Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat and others have been caught doing everything from violating users' privacy and lying about it to undermining a US election by platforming a Russian intelligence agency. Maybe you even know about the resistance these companies have put up to cracking down on child sexual abuse material and bullying that's resulted in teen suicides.  I case some of this sounds a little unfamiliar, let me just remind you of a few of the things that users of these platforms are implicitly condoning.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2019/07/ftc-imposes-5-billion-penalty-sweeping-new-privacy-restrictions-facebook'>FTC Imposes $5 Billion Penalty and Sweeping New Privacy Restrictions on Facebook | Federal Trade Commission</a> - I case you're wondering, this happened during the first Trump administration, not under the Democrats. Facebook blatantly lied for years to users to lull them into thinking their personal information was protected while selling it to the highest bidder, including personal telephone numbers. It subjected users photographs to illegal facial recognition software.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58058428'>Anti-Semitic social posts 'not taken down' in 80% of cases</a> - Even when notified of Neo-Nazis posting hateful and derogatory content, the big platforms only take action in one case out of four. On the other hand, I've had posts removed that extolled the French resistance against the Nazis in World War Two removed. I recently posted a cover of Time Magazine's Man of the Year for 1936 (Hitler) to compare it to 2024's MOY (Trump). That post was also removed.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.cbsnews.com/news/facebook-instagram-meta-mark-zuckerberg-children-pedophiles-new-mexico-lawsuit/'>Facebook and Instagram are steering child predators to kids, New Mexico AG alleges - CBS News</a> - An undercover investigation  set up phony accounts of fictional teens and preteens, using photographs generated by artificial intelligence. Meta's algorithms recommended sexual content to those accounts, which were also subject to a stream of explicit messages and propositions from adults on the platforms.</p>\n<p><a href='https://archive.ph/ylfBO'>Has Social Media Fuelled a Teen-Suicide Crisis? | The New Yorker</a> - A product manager at Facebook named Frances Haugen. Haugen, ...released thousands of the company’s internal documents to the Securities and Exchange Commission and to the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, claiming that the company knew about the harmful effects of social media on mental health but consistently chose “profit over safety.”</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.npr.org/2024/10/04/nx-s1-5137218/snapchat-brushed-aside-warnings-of-child-harm-documents-show'>Snapchat brushed aside warnings of child harm, documents show : NPR</a> - An internal email shows the company received around 10,000 reports of sextortion per month. Employees pointed to one account that had 75 complaints against it, and it wasn't taken down. Internally, Snapchat said that addressing child grooming would create privacy issues and be too expensive.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

I think there's a lot of wisdom and practical life advice in many tenets of various faiths, including Christianity, the one with which I am most familiar. If you don't believe the golden rule has practical applications in personal relationships, we probably won't be friends. Unlike a lot of in your face Christians though, I am much more comfortable with the Beatitudes than I am with the 10 Commandments. \"Blessed are the peacemakers. Blessed are the merciful\" I can get behind that.</p>\n<p>My sister is a minister in the Methodist Church. Aside from religion, we share a lot of similar beliefs about the world and about the solutions for its problems. I get angry when someone makes it known how much they love Jesus and yet they vote for a party or politicians who promise to cut food programs for the poor, as an example. My sister explained how some people truly believe that the answer to poverty is the food kitchen at their church, where they donate their time and money, taking a personal interest in the people who show up there. OK. I think that kind of labor and commitment is admirable. I don't think it's a comprehensive answer to poverty, but I don't look down on it.</p>\n<p>When there are natural disasters, and I live in hurricane country where they are common, there are organized teams from faith based organizations who show up with boots on the ground to help people. The provide food and other necessities to anyone who needs it. Habitat for Humanity has a great record of helping people achieve home ownership. Mission teams routinely go to Haiti and other impoverished counties in this hemisphere to provide medical care and construction labor. That's real tangible stuff.</p>\n<p>Yes, there are massive problems and contradictions with religion worldwide and particularly in my country. Covering up the sexual abuse of children by priests for decades is inexcusable. The church's attitude toward the LGBT community is a direct contradiction to the premise that God is love. The right-wing claim to be the party of God is offensive to anyone, even non-believers, who have ever read the Bible. The persecution of immigrants, the denial of food, shelter and medical care to people in need in a country with so much excess wealth is obscene. I'm not making any excuses for that.</p>\n<p>Except for the believing in God part, most of my personal ethical and moral standards would past muster with the church. When I see someone who is comforted by their faith, I am nothing but happy for them. It's a damn cruel world and all of us has to take comfort wherever we can find it.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2025/facebook-is-evil.webp\" alt=\"Facebook_Is_Evil\" /></p>\n<p>Even after it became obvious that Facebook was an invasive cancer on not just the Internet, but all society, I kept my account. There were too many ways it was ingrained into my life. It was the way my cycling club announced rides and planned events. Friends who moved away years ago kept in touch with me through Facebook. So many people on the job where I worked for 20 years had accounts and I could up with them. I had 16 years of photos from family birthday parties, Christmas get-togethers and I could see my grandchildren's first days of school and their graduations. That's what kept me there. It wasn't for the opportunity to look at and post memes or to preach to the choir or lecture people on how to feel about this or that, although I did do some of all of that too. I'd use it occasionally when I got bored to see clips of the Beatles, old boxing matches and baseball games from my youth. It was good for that.</p>\n<p>I had a Twitter account too, but it was never that important to me. I didn't have many real relationships there. I mainly followed hard new journalists and tech people. I liked to follow it during presidential debates, which make my stomach hurt if i try to watch them. I'd much rather read the astonished takes from journos about whatever put-downs the politicians were using on each other. When I started blogging, I used Twitter as just another place to put links to my app reviews and Obsidian how-to articles. I talked to a few people, but all my real interacting was happening on Mastodon. Finally, I decided I just couldn't be someone who hung out at that particular Nazi bar just to get a few more eyeballs on my little personal, n on-monetized blog. I closed my account and didn't have a single emotion as a result. It was just checking something off a to-do list.</p>\n<p>When Mark Zuckerberg while wearing a $900,000 watch, announced last week that Meta was going to stop fact checking, I knew the end was near. Then that asshole went on Joe Rogan and lied. He claimed he was bullied by the meanies in the Biden administration who yelled at him for letting Republicans tell people not to wear masks or get vaccinated during the deadliest pandemic in a century. That was followed by an announcement that Meta was going to end its diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. As if that weren't enough, Facebook deleted content it had bragged about creating for trans and non-binary people. I couldn't take it.</p>\n<p>I sat down and marked my Threads and Instagram accounts for deletion. I requested an archive of the thousands of pictures and posts I had on Facebook, dating all the way back to the George W. Bush administration. When that comes through, Facebook is gone.  Down here in the south we still have plenty of all white organizations ranging from private  swimming pools, to country clubs to churches and ceremonial military units. Those are just the organized all white organizations. Lots of ad hoc groups are intensely exclusionary, too. I made a point a long, long time ago to avoid all of that and never, ever willingly participate or endorse all white spaces. I'm not going to participate in fact free or gay free or trans free spaces either. I'm not going to be responsible for a single set of eyes looking at a damn thing Mark Zuckerberg or Elon Musk profit from.  I am embarrassed that it took me so long.</p>\n<p>It's been a decade since Facebook ran an experiment on the accounts of a whopping 600,000 people to see if it could make them sad by what it exposed them to. Yeah, they really did that and it worked. People found about it. It made the news. Nothing ever came of it because in America, billionaires are like Ricky Bobby's sons. They get to do whatever they want.</p>\n<p>You do you. I'm not here to tell you that using Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, or Threads makes you a bad person. If you stay, I'll assume that you have a good reason. I just can't think of one that would let me use something that will be a prime means if spreading disinformation to millions of people, disinformation that will hurt and possibly even kill them. Too dramatic? I think not. That's what it comes down to. The people running that company and the politicians they are now supporting don't give a shit if you live or die. They just want to extract as much wealth from you as they can.</p>\n<p>Get a Mastodon account. Get a Bluesky account. Just stay away from billionaire owned manipulation machines.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

She's been there several years longer than I have, and she's the associate VP for finance and controller in charge of the finance department and some other stuff like the book store and the post office. She goes to meetings, has a corporate credit card, and people have to ask her for permission to do stuff. Me, I am the old guy in the IT department who you ask for a mouse when yours dies. If someone is giving me a hard time, i just casually mention who I am married to and they leave me alone. I have a system.</p>\n<p>Of course, in her private life, she's a talented ultramarathon runner, winner of races from distances of 50K to 100 miles. She routinely outruns paratroopers from the 82nd Airborne Division and college athletes. We've been married since 2013. I'm her biggest cheerleader. Standing in her shadow is my favorite place to be.</p>\n<p>I, as they say, used to be kinda famous in our circles too. I met her at one of many century (100 mile) bike rides I organized. I traveled all over this country and Europe as an organizer and speaker. Before I retired from my career job, I'd been the senior person in my role for years. These days though, my athletic career is over and I'd quit my job before I let them promote me to a position with more authority or responsibility. There's not even a war for me to protest. I'm fine thanks.</p>\n<p>Here are some stories about other guys in the anonymous husbands club.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.vogue.com/article/celebrities-married-to-normal-people'>24 Times Celebrities Married—or Dated—Normal People | Vogue</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://people.com/what-do-the-husbands-of-these-famous-stars-do-8610678'>What the Husbands of Stars Do for a Living</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://www.buzzfeed.com/mjs538/celeb-spouses'>34 Celebrity Spouses You Didn't Know Existed</a><BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2025/2023-05-04-08-44-22-836.webp\" alt=\"Wonder Woman\" /></p>\n<p>Tomorrow is Wonder Woman's birthday. To prove to everyone that age doesn't stop her, she's going on a four-run...but wait, there's more. Today we had a WFH opportunity because of the threat of snow. We decided to take some PTO and make the familiar drive to the Uwharrie National Forest, a couple of hours from where we live. Some call the place the Uwharrie Mountains and they were -- a couple of eons today. Today they are a series of short but steep climbs, although none of them are over 1,000 feet. One of the US National Scenic Trails runs through the forest and this is where she wants to run...in the snow...on her birthday.</p>\n<p>We've been coming here for years. It is a fun place to hike and camp. There are also cosy little cabins available, which is where we're staying this weekend. We've tented through a snow and ice storm here before though, just to say we'd done it. In hindsight, it may not have been the most comfortable night's sleep I ever had, but it's a fond memory. The one-room cabin we are in is nice though. It's heated, has a kitchen, shower and wi-fi - just the basic essentials.</p>\n<p>At the end of the month, we are going to Florida for a long weekend so Wonder Woman can keep a promise to her cousin to run the Miami Marathon with her. WW's extended family lives in the area. Her grandfather moved there in the fifties when he got out of the Army and my mother-in-laws siblings all stayed in the area. I've only been there once and that was more than thirty years ago on the way to Key West. It's always nice to get away from home and experience something new.</p>\n<p>My 60th birthday is next month and we will be getting out of town for that too. There is a lakeside hotel about an hour away where we've been a couple of times. Of course it has easy access to an excellent running trail. There is a Lebanese restaurant there I really like, and it's what I've picked for my birthday dinner. I just want to lounge around for the weekend, do some writing, maybe watch a movie, visit the REI and relax.</p>\n<p>I found out today that WW signed up for a race in South Carolina in March that lasts for 10 hours. The participants have to run a 5K every hour on the hour - for a total of 50K by the end of the day. Whoever has the fastest cumulative time will be the winner. The race is called <a href='https://www.peytonsrace.com/index.html'>Payton's Wild and Wacky 50K</a> and it's in the low country area near Charleston where there are lots of great events. A few years ago she even got me to do <a href='https://bridgerun.com'>the Bridge Run</a>, which is one of the largest 10Ks in the world with over 40,000 participants. The next day we did a 100K bike ride, fittingly called <a href='https://www.postandcourier.com/charleston_scene/latest_headlines/largest-local-ride-is-the-day-after-largest-run/article_fbde0e93-fd13-58b7-9da3-e70d8d975c1e.html'>The After the Bridge Run Ride.</a></p>\n<p>If it weren't for Wonder Woman, I'd lead a pretty uneventful life, being a homebody and just getting out to go see the grandkids once in a while.

In July 2013, after spending the night sleeping on the floor of the Lake in the Clouds Hut operated by the Appalachian Mountain Club in New Hampshire's White Mountain National park, Wonder Woman and I climbed the highest mountain in the northeast United States, to the 6,288 ft. peak of Mt. Washington. As we started the long climb, a sign placed by the US Forest Service stood beside the trail with a stark warning proclaiming <strong>\"THE AREA AHEAD HAS THE WORST WEATHER IN AMERICA. MANY HAVE DIED THERE FROM EXPOSURE, EVEN IN THE SUMMER. TURN BACK NOW IF THE WEATHER IS BAD. WHITE MOUNTAIN NATIONAL FOREST\"</strong></p>\n<p>Fortunately.the weather on this mid-summer day was cloudy and a little windy, although we could see sunshine down in the valley below. It took a couple of hours to reach the peak. The winds grew increasingly stronger and we were soaked by the moisture in the clouds passing around (not over) us. At the summit, there is a weather station that's been there for decades and is manned 24/7/365. There was a place where you could see the weather conditions, including the wind speed. On our summit day, the steady winds were blowing at 50 MPH with gusts up to 60 MPH. We were both wearing every layer of clothing we carried in our backpacks.</p>\n<p>One of the most intimidating things I've ever seen was the plaque for all the people who have lost their lives on the mountain. It was crowded with names, but they'd left room to add more, as if it were some perverse employee of the moth club.</p>\n<p>Just to give you an idea why that spot has the worst weather in the US, read below about the April day in 1934 when the wind speed was recorded at 231 MPH on two separate occasions, a record that stood until a higher speed was recorded during a Pacific cyclone during the 1990s.</p>\n<p><a href='https://mountwashington.org/remembering-the-big-wind/'>Remembering the Big Wind - Mount Washington Observatory</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://www.foxweather.com/extreme-weather/big-wind-day-mount-washington-231-mph-gust-anniversary-new-hampshire'>Happy ‘Big Wind Day': 90 years since incredible 231 mph gust at Mount Washington | Fox Weather</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Washington'>Mount Washington - Wikipedia</a></p>\n<h2 id=a-hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomshortsrite6end3aawonder-woman-coming-up-the-mountaina><a href='https://www.youtube.com/shorts/RiTe6End3AA'>Wonder Woman Coming Up the Mountain</a></h2><BR>\n<BR>[Enjoyed it?

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2025/22-1.webp\" alt=\"BearBlog\" /></p>\n<p>I didn't find out until yesterday that Ava challenged me to answer these questions in <a href='https://blog.avas.space/bear-blog-challenge/'>her initial post.</a> I'd been kind of sad that no one had invited me to participate, so yeah, I'm a dunce. My apologies to Ava for taking so long.</p>\n<h2 id=why-did-you-make-the-blog-in-the-first-place>Why Did You Make the Blog in the First Place?</h2><p>I retired in 2020 and I spent most of 2021 and 2022 off the Internet and used very little technology. I went months without opening my computer and my phone usage was mostly doom-scrolling Reddit and never posting. To get out of that lethargy, I decided to go back to work at a low stress job at the university where my wife works. I spent my whole carer in IT, so I ended back in front of a computer and it eventually rekindled my interest in the tech I'd always loved. I started reading blogs again for the first time in five or six years. Through my reading, I discovered that Robb Knight had created a page where hundreds of people listed the apps they used in all areas of their lives. I really wanted to participate, but I didn't have a way to post anywhere. I did some looking around and decided to buy a domain for $1 and open an account at <a href='https://amerpie.lol'>Micro.blog,</a> just so I could make that single post and get featured on Robb's page.</p>\n<h2 id=why-did-you-choose-bearblog>Why Did You Choose Bearblog?</h2><p>Choosing Bear Blog was 100% due to FOMO. I'd become Internet friends with several bloggers who moved to Bear and were singing its praises. I'd expanded my own blogging after a few months from just Micro.Blog to include Scribbles which hosted <a href='https://louplummer.lol'>Living Out Loud</a> and <a href='https://apps.louplummer.lol'>AppAddict</a>. To make use of BearBlog, I transferred <a href='https://louplummer.lol'>Living Out Loud</a> in a marathon session of exporting and importing posts, so that I could join <a href='https://birming.com/'>Robert</a> and <a href='https://notes.jeddacp.com/'>Jedda</a>. It's funny that we are the very three people that <a href='https://blog.avas.space/'>Ava</a> tagged in her original post</p>\n<h2 id=have-you-blogged-on-other-platforms-before>Have You Blogged on other Platforms Before?</h2><p>Aside from Micro.blog and Scribbles, I also blogged at the late great Geo Cities back in the early days of the Internet. I used my own domain, wonderfulmonds.com, named after a minor league baseball player. In 2013, I blogged every one of the 156 days it took to thruhike the Appalachian Trail. That blog is still online at the Trail Journals website. <a href='https://www.trailjournals.com/leftyandhush/'>Lefty and Hush's 2013 Appalachian Trail Journal : Part of Trail Journals' Backpacking and Hiking Journals</a></p>\n<h2 id=do-you-write-your-posts-directly-in-the-editor-or-in-another-software>Do You Write Your Posts Directly in the Editor or in Another Software?</h2><p>I never write directly in the editor at BearBlog or anywhere else. Almost all of my writing is done in Obsidian or in Drafts on my phone when I am traveling. I use a template in the editor to feature web mentions and for the header to write a meta_description and include a meta_image. I've tried hard over the years to preserve what I've written. I have documents I created in the late 90s on my computer along with the 800 or so posts I've written in the past year.</p>\n<h2 id=when-do-you-feel-most-inspired-to-write>When Do You Feel Most Inspired to Write?</h2><p>I usually want to write when I'm supposed to be doing something else. The whole ritual of sitting down at the computer, opening a new document and typing the title gives me a rush. I can write with the world going crazy around me. I like a good quiet early morning when it is still dark outside but I do my best writing later in the day when I have had time to chew on a few ideas. I write three posts a day, so writing is usually on my mind.</p>\n<h2 id=do-you-publish-immediately-after-writing-or-do-you-let-it-simmer-a-bit-as-a-draft>Do You Publish Immediately after Writing or Do You Let it Simmer a Bit as a Draft?</h2><p>LOL - sometimes I don't even have the patience to proofread what I write. I don't use a system of drafts. What people read is what came out of head and onto my computer screen pretty much verbatim. Any rewriting is the \"oh shit\" variety when I spot typos in what I have already published or when some kind soul writes me and informs me of some egregious mistake.</p>\n<h2 id=your-favorite-post-on-your-blog>Your Favorite post on Your Blog?</h2><p>I wrote a piece in for September's IndieWeb Carnival on <a href='https://louplummer.lol/power-underneath-despair/'>the last bottle of bourbon I drank</a>. That was in 2008. I've been sober ever since after a long, long fight with addiction. When I published it, my oldest daughter who was obviously affected by all of that while growing up, sent me a simple \"I love you\" and it was meaningful in a deep and powerful way.</p>\n<h2 id=any-future-plans-for-your-blog-maybe-a-redesign-changing-the-tag-system-etc>Any Future Plans for Your Blog? Maybe a Redesign, Changing the Tag System, Etc.?</h2><p>Blog design is such a rabbit hole. I'm pretty happy with the way things look now, even though it's kind of bland and cookie cutter. I don't know CSS beyond what nice people give to me after I ask them a question. I tend to make small changes, usually leaning towards ease of use stuff for myself over time. I appreciate well-designed personal sites, but I'm more into writing than I am into colors, fonts and graphics.\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

I remember pictures of the world's heaviest twins riding motorcycles and the name of the tallest man who ever lived (Robert Wadlow).  As it turns out, I am not alone in my appreciation for this unusual record book. Over 150 million copies have been sold in yearly editions. 2025 will mark the 70th time the book is issued.</p>\n<p>In 1954, the managing director of the Guinness Brewing Company had the idea to create a book to settle arguments between pub patrons. He planned to give the books away to the owners of public house in the United Kingdon. He hired a pair of brothers to compile the book, sports journalists <a href='https://www.britannica.com/biography/Norris-McWhirter'>Norris</a> and <a href='https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ross-McWhirter'>Ross McWhirter</a>. The first edition contained about 4,000 records and was so popular that within months more copies were printed and this time for sale.

I can tell when I was feeling light-hearted or when politics have had me riled up. When I write <a href='https://louplummer.lol/my-favorite-man/'>about my (grown) kids</a> it is usually a reflection of when I'm missing them. My dear sweet Mom reads every post and I put little messages to her in here and <a href='https://louplummer.lol/when-you-cuss-in-front-of-your-mama-you-cant-take-it-back/'>try not to cuss</a>.  I'm honest about my <a href='https://louplummer.lol/talking-about-mental-health/'>mental health.</a> Sometimes I <a href='https://louplummer.lol/taking-a-mental-health-day/'>vent my frustrations</a> from work, or you know, people.</p>\n<p>Every time I have ever tried to keep a journal, it's quickly devolved into nothing more than just a daily narrative - when I got up, what I did at work, what I did in the evening. I always start off thinking I'll inject some emotion into it, something that future me will read with admiration. It just never happens. I've used the great journaling app, <a href='https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/day-one-is-popular-for-a-reason'>Day One,</a> since 2014, but it is more of a digital scrapbook into which I funnel photographs, social media posts, books, movies and TV shows watched and news stories. It's fun to maintain and look through, but I don't get much of a clue about how past me felt on all those days unless one of the photos conjures up a memory.</p>\n<p>Before I started this blog, I'd had two stints of writing for other people behind me. One was back in the 90s before we had social media. I used to write essays and include them in our family email chain. I've republished a couple of them <a href='https://louplummer.lol/the-wayback-machine/'>here</a> and <a href='https://louplummer.lol/born-a-rockefeller/'>here</a>. The email chain petered out and most of the writing I did for the next decade was technical in nature.</p>\n<p>In 2013, my wife and I hiked the Appalachian Trail on a five-month honeymoon. I used an iPhone 5 to <a href='http://www.trailjournals.com/leftyandhush/'>write a blog entry every night</a> in our tent or whatever hostel we happened to be in with pictures and details from the day's journey. I thought about continuing it when we got home, but going back to work and a lack of spectacular views and adventure extinguished that flame.</p>\n<p>These days. I average about 1,000 words a day. I write about anything I feel like for most of that, although I dedicate some time to my hobby of writing app reviews. I went through my first hundred days and created <a href='https://louplummer.lol/50-ideas-for-blog-posts/'>a list of blogging prompts,</a> which several people have amazingly taken and completed 50 or more of their own posts from.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href='https://forkingmad.blog/blog/?q=FiftyIn50'>David at Forking Mad</a></li>\n<li><a href='https://substack.com/@honestlass/posts'>HonestLass</a></li>\n<li><a href='https://mandarismoore.com/archive/'>Mandaris</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Last week, I celebrated the one-year anniversary of <a href='https://amerpie.lol/2024/01/06/amerpies-default-apps.html'>my first blog post</a> in my re-entry into the world of personal bloggers. I didn't start the crazy post something every day thing until March. I've written for my blog <a href='https://louplummer.lol/hurricanes-and-pre-race-jitters/'>during a hurricane</a>. I kept it going through <a href='https://linkage.lol/camping-with-kids/'>a camping trip</a> with five of my grandchildren. More than a few posts have been pecked out on my phone during road trips and airplane flights. I am much more dedicated to talking to y'all than I ever was writing for myself. Thankfully, I have an open-book personality. I'm not guarded about much. My life has been <a href='https://louplummer.lol/power-underneath-despair/'>messy and imperfect</a>, but I've done some <a href='https://louplummer.lol/what-do-you-do-for-fun/'>fun stuff</a>and some <a href='https://louplummer.lol/my-longest-day/'>hard stuff</a> and ended up pretty happy for the most part.

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/21-1.webp\" alt=\"Teacher_and_student\" /></p>\n<p>It's ironic that I've worked in schools for the majority of my adult life. Except for a year here and there, I didn't enjoy the 12 years I spent in public education. It could have something to do with attending 13 schools during that time. The years I liked happened because of special teachers, the kind who know how to engage kids and who treat them like the little humans they are.</p>\n<p>It's been popular in the press and in political circles for many years to claim that public education is failing. Standardized test scores are treated like the holy grail in this data-driven age. State legislatures pass laws to do things like mandate that students be taught their multiplication tables, implying that they are not learning that already, when of course they are. In a nod to tradition, people who don't know how to send an email pass laws that force instruction in things like cursive writing while eliminating jobs for people who teach art, music or who work in the library.</p>\n<p>Conservatives aren't the only ones who denigrate education, but they're the people who want to take money from the school budget and give to shady for-profit and poorly supervised charter schools. They also favor giving to religious schools teaching that man and dinosaurs walked the earth together. In many southern states, <a href='https://www.propublica.org/series/segregation-academies'>segregation academies</a>  get public money for their mostly white student body, while the public schools in the same area are underfunded. Take a look at the study from Pro Publica that I've linked to.</p>\n<p>Somehow the right-wingers have convinced people that there are teacher's unions everywhere that care nothing about children and that exist only to extort money from the government. In my home state of North Carolina, a law exists that forbids any public employee from joining a union. There are no negotiated contracts. There is no right to strike. Teachers and every other school employee takes what the state decides they should have, or they go work somewhere else. Many teachers already have a second job. I've seen them waiting tables, behind cash registers and at the plasma center. Our legislators even abolished higher pay grades for advanced degrees, while simultaneously complaining about teacher quality.</p>\n<p>Of course, there is a bell curve when it comes to the competence of teachers, just like there is a bell curve in every other profession. Most teachers care a great deal about what their students are learning. I've listened to many, many excited explanations of new ways to teach first-graders addition or high schoolers chemistry. You can see the real passion in so many teachers and the work they put into their lessons. I've seen plenty of them stay at school long after they could have left for the day, just so they could provide extra help to kids who are behind.</p>\n<p>The US as a whole is doing pretty damn well for a country that supposedly has a failing educational system. These days I work in higher ed at a private university and I don't hear our professors complaining about unprepared students in their classes. As someone who works in IT, I can also tell you that these young people are learning tech skills somewhere because keeping them on the straight and narrow path and out of places where they shouldn't go is a full-time job.</p>\n<p>Next time you hear someone start the old \"our schools are failing\" routine, stop them and probe a little deeper. The chances are that they've bought into the big lie.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

That was the\nsudden and dramatic end to my life on the high seas.

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/two_men_talking.webp\" alt=\"Two_Men_Talking\" /></p>\n<p>If you have any familiarity with 12 Steps groups or if you've seen movies like 28 Days or TV shows like The Wire, then you may be familiar with two of the steps that scare the hell out of newcomers. They are the 4th and 5th Steps of the recovery program first laid out in the 1930s  and followed by millions since.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.</li>\n<li>Admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm not a believer in a supernatural God, and I've been sober a long time, so don't let the seemingly religious references throw you off. The principals behinds performing these two practices are beneficial. Rather than trying to forget the past, it's better to face up to it. People doing this take the opportunity to look at their resentments and to see what part they may have played in them. Every so often they find that they don't have any responsibility, such as in cases of abuse. Frequently with their beefs with exes, old bosses or family members, they find they did have a part to play. Even just figuring out the why of our relationship issues is helpful. Typically it comes down to fear. We are afraid we are not going to get something we want, or we are afraid we are going to lose something we already have. The most common way to manifest fear is through anger.</p>\n<p>After we've taken the time to take a good look at ourselves, comes the next step, where we ask someone, maybe a trusted friend but more typically a respected person in the recovering community to hear us admit, out loud the list of things we've done wrong, that we feel guilty about and the part we have played in all the important difficult relationships in our life.</p>\n<p>The first time I did this, I did it with an old-timer named Pete on a weekday afternoon. I was 22, but definitely an alcoholic in need of recovery. I was so scared I was shaking but over the course of an hour or so I laid it all out. Pete laughed at many of my confessions, giving examples from his life where he'd done the same thing, sometimes to a greater degree than I ever had.All my life I'd felt different from other people, terminally unique they call it.I found out that day that I wasn't all that different from I guy I really respected.</p>\n<p>Since then, I've had more than one opportunity to hear other people admit their garbage. At the end, I always ask them \"What is your deepest darkest secret?\" You can see them struggle to let go of that secret, but they always do. It's always a relief not to ever have to carry that around with you anymore.</p>\n<p>We are as sick as our secrets. They foster feelings of shame and guilt. They make us feel different and unworthy. People pay a lot of money for therapy to have someone hear them out. That's OK. Whatever it takes. I've been luck over the past 38 years to have a community of people who have listened to me without judgment when I've needed to get stuff off my chest.</p>\n<p>I do the very best I can be today to live a life where I can be honest with the people around me. I don't lie to my wife or my boss or my children or my parents. I'd rather tell them something they would rather not hear than carry around a bunch of emotional baggage that secrets cause. You don't have to an alcoholic or an addict to use the principles behind this way of living. People have used this philosophy to get relief from all kinds of destructive behavior from gambling, to over eating to compulsive sexual behavior and co-dependent relationships. There is hope for everyone.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

At that age, I lived and breathed the game, memorizing stats, collecting baseball cards and counting down the days until the game of the week came on television. As a promotion, the local team had a Hall of Fame player named Bob Feller appear one night to sign autographs and meet the fans.</p>\n<p>Feller was the greatest pitcher of his era. He entered the major leagues when he was 17. Before he turned 21 he already had a 24-win season under his belt. He played the game from 1936-1956, with a four-year break to serve in the navy aboard the USS Alabama where he saw combat and rose to the rank of chief petty officer. He was elected to the Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility, receiving the highest percentage of votes than any player preceding him.</p>\n<p>At the park that night, after he finished signing all the programs and talking to the fans, instead of leaving and going back to his hotel, he surprised me by going into the box seats to stay and watch the game. He was sitting all by himself and I just couldn't help myself. Even though I didn't have a ticket for that section, I went down there anyway and asked him if I could sit with him. He told me that I absolutely could. I talked his ear off. When I mentioned that I knew he was in the Navy, he really became animated, Despite all the accolades he'd gotten for his athletic career, he seemed to be more proud of being a sailor than for anything else. As the game progressed, he commented on the players and their skills, always complementing them. He was just a gem of a human being.</p>\n<p>Defining someone as a hero is a curious practice when you think about it. The term gets used loosely. I usually consider a hero to be someone who has displayed some sort of bravery or overcome serious obstacles. In some cases, heroes are people who have gone above and beyond to help other people. There are many musicians, actors, and athletes whose talent I really admire, but I don't consider them to be heroic for that. In some cases, though, the people in the entertainment business have done other things that make them someone to look up to.</p>\n<p>Pete Seeger worked to end segregation and performed for striking workers all over the country. When he was brought before Congress and accused of being a communist, he refused to name names when asked about the activities of others, unlike Ronald Reagan who squealed on his fellow actors.</p>\n<p>Robin Williams made secret visits to hospitals to visit and entertain children, and was well known for using his connections to help other people. An avid cyclist, he once went out to help a stranger who had a flat on his bike in front of Williams home. When the problem turned out to be more complicated than that, Williams went and got one of his bikes and just gave it to the guy. I don't know if any of that rises to the level of heroism, but he was sure a nice person.</p>\n<p>Other than Bob Feller, I haven't had many run-ins with celebrities. Maybe the closes I came was getting a call from Ron Kovic, a paralyzed Vietnam veteran who wrote a book called Born on the Fourth pf July about his post-war experiences. Tom Cruise played him in the movie by the same name. Kovic, who was 100% a hero for numerous reasons, called me to encourage me in the work I was doing to organize veterans and military families in the early days of the Iraq War. I was blown away by his kindness.</p>\n<p>We're all entitled to consider anyone we want as a hero. Just choose wisely and put some though into it.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

I don't need to win the lottery or be gifted a new car to achieve perfection. All I want is a day filled with things that are already my favorites and I am a happy man.</p>\n<p>My perfect day starts early, like 4:30 am. Easing downstairs in a silent house to turn on a single lamp for a little soft lighting before dawn is OK with me. I'll ease into the kitchen to brew a cup of coffee. The first one of the day is always the best. While I drink it, I'll catch up with my personal email and social media. On a perfect day, i'll have messages from a few Internet friends, and definitely have some new pictures of some of my grandkids in my messages. Wonder Woman generally wakes up in a good mood and I'm always happy to see her make her way to the living room where we do most of our hanging out.</p>\n<p>She will have a cop of coffee and a small glass of juice or half a banana before she goes for her run. It will be a short one and when she gets back and grabs a shower, we will go to the diner at the end of the street where we are regulars. The waitresses all know us and haven't offered us menus in years. I'll take yet another picture of my wife from across the table. That's part of the ritual. I have a couple hundred from inside that very restaurant.</p>\n<p>When we get back home, we will hang out together. She reads or watches something on her iPad. I've got three blog posts to write, so I'll start working on them. After I finish the first one, I'll probably set my computer down for a few minutes and grab a quick nap. We will forage for something to eat in a couple of hours. By then, I will have heard from one or more of the kids or maybe my Mom. I love my family dearly and staying in touch means a lot to me.</p>\n<p>After lunch would be a good time to see the three closest grandchildren. It doesn't take much to make them happy. Just a trip to Dairy Queen or going for a walk at the park is enough to satisfy them. The kids are great huggers, both to say hello and goodbye. That makes me happy.</p>\n<p>When we get home, Wonder Woman and I will probably watch a movie, which we do in our spare bedroom, reclined on the bed  where she rests her head on my chest so I can kiss the top of her head every couple of minutes or so. She will generally watch anything I pick out. I keep a running list and I just pick whatever sounds good at the moment.</p>\n<p>Tonight we had a perfect day conversation that went like this:</p>\n<p>Lou: You know what would be awesome?<BR>\nWW: What?<BR>\nLou: If you order us some pizza!<BR>\nWW: That would be awesome!<BR></p>\n<p>I don't have to cook AND I get pizza. That's perfect.</p>\n<p>After dinner, I'll finish my daily blogging, stopping to watch the videos she plays for me on her iPad from the other end of the couch. Her favorite genre are videos making fun of men for doing typical man things. Tonight it was a guy who answered multiple trivia questions in a row but could not remember the text his wife sent him just hours before with a grocery request that included a picture of what she needed.</p>\n<p>We will go to bed early on the perfect day, because unless we are driving back from a trip, we always go to bed early. My preferred ritual is to read blog posts in my RSS reader until I can't keep my eyes open. I sleep pretty good. I have a lot of perfect days.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

In 1986, I spent a month in the Mojave Desert at Ft. Irwin while in the Army. I got one hot shower during the entire month and most of the cleaning I did was by pouring canteens of water over my head with its GI haircut. Some tankers that were there had a bucket shower they hung off the gun barrel of an M-1 Abrams. I though they were nuts standing under a slow drizzle of cold water buck naked for all the world to see.</p>\n<p>In 2013, my wife and I spent five and half months hiking one of the US National Scenic trails. Showers were infrequent , averaging about once a week. No long distance hikers carry deodorant (too heavy) and the phrase \"hiker stank\" is no exaggeration. When hitch-hiking from the trail into town to buy food, we had more than one person suddenly roll down the windows \"to let in some fresh air.\" Most daily cleaning was done standing beside a creek with a bandana and a few drops of <a href='https://www.drbronner.com'>Dr. Bonner's Pure Castile Soap</a> - which some brave souls even used to brush their teeth.</p>\n<p>Here are some facts about the history of bathing.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href='https://www.discovermagazine.com/health/a-history-of-bathing-it-hasnt-always-been-about-hygiene'>The Romans were frequent bathers</a> but they did it for social reasons rather than hygeine.</li>\n<li>The prevalence of the plague during the middle ages<a href='https://www.cnn.com/style/article/cultural-history-of-bathing-rituals/index.html'>caused people to stop bathing for hundreds of years</a>because they thought it opened up ones pores and let in disease.</li>\n<li>When bathing became popular in the US in the 1860s, baths were relegated to <a href='https://daily.jstor.org/when-americans-started-bathing/'>very quick dips in cold water</a></li>\n<li>In 2021 <a href='https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-58184325'>Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis made headlines</a>when they admitted to being averse to soap and water and to only bathing their children when they were visibly dirty.</li>\n<li>The world's <a href='https://www.spabaths.co/blog/a-guided-tour-to-the-worlds-most-expensive-baths'>most expensive bathtubs</a> are generally carved from a single piece of stone, with the record holder coming from a huge piece of petrified wood, valued at $1.9 million.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

In the course of crafting a single blog post, I might use\nfour or five apps.</p>\n\n<p>For screenshots, I use <a\nhref=\"https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/cleanshot-x\">CleanShotX</a> which\nI call from a keyboard shortcut or the menu bar. It also does\nannotation. The files are saved to my default screenshot folder that\nlives on a cloud drive so that I can readily access it from all my\ncomputers and devices.</p>\n\n<p>When the file is saved, it activates <a\nhref=\"https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/clop-copy-big-paste-small-send-fast\">Clop</a>\nwhich optimizes the file size automatically. The optimized file is\nhanded off to <a\nhref=\"https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/dropover-best-in-class\">Dropover</a>\nand then an <a\nhref=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/5fb38973fcb64f89be4185276f3c654a\">Apple\nShortcut</a> (download link) runs that moves the file to another cloud\nfolder, called &quot;Optimized&quot; and which also opens a <a\nhref=\"https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/dropover-best-in-class\">Dropover</a>\nshelf so that I can drag the file into place if my current working\nsituation calls for it. <a\nhref=\"https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/dropover-best-in-class\">Dropover</a>\nalso lets me rename the file, convert to another format and resize the\nfile. I can even open the file in <a\nhref=\"https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/imageoptim-free-and-open-source-utility-to-reduce-file-sizes\">ImageOptim</a>\nright from the shelf if I want to reduce the file size to a greater\nextent than <a\nhref=\"https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/clop-copy-big-paste-small-send-fast\">Clop</a>\nperformed.</p>\n\n<p>For images other than screenshots, they go straight to my downloads\nfolder, where they get optimized by <a\nhref=\"https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/clop-copy-big-paste-small-send-fast\">Clop</a>\nand then moved to the &quot;Optimized&quot; folder by a shortcut ready for use.</p>\n\n<p>Since I go through numerous images, I don&#39;t want my &quot;Optimized&quot; folder\nto get bloated, so I use <a\nhref=\"https://amerpie.lol/2024/05/10/my-favorite-actions.html\">Hazel</a>\nto move files that are more than one day old. It sorts the files in two\nways. Screenshots (which have a special string in the file name)are\nmoved to a &quot;Screenshots-Old&quot; folder. The rest of the image files, which\ncan be jpg, png, svg or webp get sorted by file extension and moved to\nan archive folder. <a\nhref=\"https://amerpie.lol/2024/05/10/my-favorite-actions.html\">Hazel</a>\ndoes all this based on pre-configured rules, and it all happens\nautomatically.</p>\n\n<p>For images other than screenshots, they go straight to my downloads\nfolder, where they get optimized by <a\nhref=\"https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/clop-copy-big-paste-small-send-fast\">Clop</a>\nand then moved to the &quot;Optimized&quot; folder by a shortcut ready for use.</p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Putting Mac Apps to Work - Image Management Workflow for Writers' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

You might benefit from exploring your emotions more and being more tolerant of work flows that are not perfect..</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Scanning my email for links to share is a daily habit. I post <a href='https://amerpie.lol/my-bookmarks/'>\"This Week's Bookmarks\"</a> every weekend. That's a collection of random, but hopefully interesting, web pages I've collected over the preceding seven days. I'll post anything from recipes, to photo exhibits to anything that might someone say \"whoa!\" Today I found <a href='https://www.expand.fm/'>a site that will do a personality analysis</a> of any Reddit user. I couldn't get my name typed in there fast enough. I've been <a href='https://louplummer.lol/my-reddit-account-can-vote/'>on Reddit since 2006.</a> Since I started blogging I post something there every day.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Your frequent posts and comments across multiple online platforms related to Mac apps, iOS apps, and Obsidian reveal a high level of online activity. The depth and detail of your posts further suggest a dedication to these topics and a proactive approach to sharing information.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As illustrated by the general summary above, my Reddit personality is the non-political, non-autobiographical side of me. That side comes through, I hope, in most places I go. Since the beginning of my interest in technology, dating back to the early 90s, I've enjoyed not just using a computer but finding ways to make computers do what i want them to do. The average person I encounter might be open to hearing an app recommendation or two, but I have seen too many people develop glazed eyes when I get wound up about my current list of cool things to share. That's what makes the Internet the best audience. People can opt in or out at their leisure.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You demonstrate resilience in your responses to dissenting opinions, offering logical explanations and defending your positions. This suggests a good ability to handle pressure and stress.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you've ever spent much time on Reddit, you know it can be an extremely toxic environment if you feed the trolls. I've weathered my share of nasty comments from weirdos who are upset about software of all things. Examples include being called unethical because I use a VPN that advertises on YouTube (Nord). Anything that interferes with video watching gets vitriol. I regularly get accused of being paid to write positive reviews, as if all these poor indy developers out, there have the money from their 1.99 apps to hire writers. Some trolls call me a racist because I point out the unreasonable hatred faced by a certain Ukrainian software company from Russian provocateurs.</p>\n<p>I'm going to disagree with the AI assessment that I am an introvert due to the \"informative and educational\" style of my posts. My real life personality can be a little outsized at times. I seldom like the things I like just a bit. If I'm into something, I'm really into it. I'd much rather share concrete information than make small talk, perform amateur psychological assessments of people I know or, God forbid, prattle on about the weather or lawn care. If nearby conversations devolve into chit-chat, i usually don't have much to say. When I met Wonder Woman, we spent months asking each other 'What's your favorite X\". I think sharing your passions with another person is the best way to spend time with them.</p>\n<p>I suppose I am organized and detail oriented in some ways. That doesn't translate into being neat and orderly in general, though. I manage to be a prolific blogger. I try to learn something new every day. Making those things a priority means I don't set aside time for things like washing my 20-year-old car or decluttering my full to bursting closet. Priorities, right?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You share your expertise without overt self-promotion, focusing on providing helpful information rather than boasting or comparing yourself to others.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I try not to use lines like \"In my 30 years of experience\" or \"on the log I write that gets thousands of hits a day\" because only an arrogant asshat would play that card on the first hand. I will sneak in humblebrag on a blog post, however. LOL</p>\n<p>That last line in the overall summary — \"You might benefit from exploring your emotions more and being more tolerant of work flows that are not perfect\" stems from my ongoing exasperation at seemingly knowledgeable people who buy high-end computers but refuse to use helpful applications because they might \"make my computer run slow.\" Everyone is entitled to a pet peeve and that's mine. <a href='https://louplummer.lol/a-computer-is-a-hammer/'>Of course I have a whole rant about that.</a></p>\n<p>This is quite possible the most self-centered blog post I have ever written. I'm just relieved that my computer thinks so highly of me.\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/44-2.webp\" alt=\"Pickled Eggs\" /></p>\n<p>When I'm hungry, I don't usually pine for steak or lobster. What I want is a plate of cheese and crackers, or a tin of smoked oysters, a handful of Chex Mix or some homemade pork skins. I shudder at the thought of going on a road trip without stopping by a convenience store for a Diet Coke and a bag of chips and quite possibly a Reese's Cup. Before bed, I am partial to a plate full of watermelon cubes either with some Feta cheese or sprinkled with Tajin, a Mexican spice that is great with fruit. I love an easy to peel Clementine at any time of day. I'm in my third consecutive year of eating crackers and Slim Jims every weekday morning.</p>\n<p>I enjoy cooking, and I'm pretty good at it. Furthermore, I've studied nutrition extensively, so I know how and when to prepare special meals before endurance events and how to create tasty dishes from scratch. There are several places within a few miles of my home to purchase fresh fruits and vegetables, open year round. As a dieting veteran, I'm able to accurately estimate macronutrient and calorie counts for most foods without relying on an app or a book. I'm married to a conscientious eater who is so in tune with her body that she managed to complete a 2200-mile-long distance hike weighing the same on Day 156 as she did on Day 1. </p>\n<p>I wanted to establish those credentials before making my point. Whatever I put in my mouth, I do with full knowledge of the benefits or lack thereof. Left to my own whims, I would rather snack any day then cook. Having small treats throughout the day or in certain circumstances is basically what I live for. One of my favorite parts of any holiday season is the foods associated with them. There are other ritual times to snack, but really, I'm just about always ready.</p>\n<p>A lot of this behavior is a holdover from when I was a constantly training endurance sports guy. I went for years eating six small meals a day to manage my weight and energy and to fuel for long bike rides or backpacking trips. Now that I'm older and not as active, these old habits wreak havoc on my waistline. It is an ongoing battle.</p>\n<p>Although I enjoy some sweets. I prefer savory foods. When I completed the Appalachian Trail, I'd eaten so many Snickers and Payday bars that in the past 11 years, I haven't had either one of those previous favorites. I ate honeybuns smothered in peanut butter for breakfast on the trail. It was years before I ate another one, but I will occasionally have one now, preferably with some delicious gas station coffee.</p>\n<p>I have a few unusual favorites. I enjoy a good pickled egg now and then. We have many Asian markets where I live and they just about all carry locally made kimchi, which is a Korean dish of fermented cabbage, onions and dakon radish with hot peppers. A few bites of that right of the jar does me just right. Indian mixed pickle is another delicacy. Order some as an app next time you go for some tikki masala. I like just about any kind of canned seafood. Sardines, kippers, mussels — I'll eat all of them. When I go camping, I eat my weight in beef jerky and GORP (good old raisins and peanuts). Oh, let me not forget pickled okra, I love that.</p>\n<p>If you ever make your way to North Carolina and stop by the house, I promise to make you dinner, but if you just want to join me for a few snacks, that will be alright too.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

Luckily,\ncustomizing the appearance of your device is made easier by various\nthird-party utilities. One of those is Replacicon, an outstanding app\nthat maintains a constantly updating catalog of alternate icons for your\ninstalled applications.</p>\n\n<p>The Replacicon interface shows an alphabetic list of your installed apps\nthat you can filter in different ways, showing only the apps in your\ndock or by permanently hiding apps you don&#39;t want to see listed. It\nshows you each app&#39;s current and legacy icons, allowing you to hide the\ncurrent icon if you choose. If you have apps installed outside the\ndefault locations, you can add those folders to the ones Replacicon\nsearches.</p>\n\n<p>If you have your own icons for apps, you can import those into\nReplacicon. You can also use Apple Intelligence to generate new icons if\nyour machine has that capability. The app runs on Intel and Apple\nSilicon, and on macOS 13 and higher. Your alternate icon selections are\nmaintained across app and OS updates automatically.</p>\n\n<p>Replacicon is a $5.99 one-time purchase from the <a\nhref=\"https://replacicon.app/\">developer&#39;s website.</a></p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Replacicon - Customize Your Mac' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

Dad's a big fan of military history so he had a set on World War Two, plus his own war, Vietnam. He also had the wonderful set on the old west, bound in genuine fake leather. My mother had a book with all of Norman Rockwell's Saturday Evening Post covers and I practically memorized them. As an adult, I got to go to a Rockwell exhibit at our state's art museum in Raleigh, fittingly with my Mom. My own collection of photography based books is limited to gifts I've received, most of them centered around my love of classic rock music.</p>\n<p>I look through my own photographs almost daily, both my run of the mill iPhone snapshots and the photos I've taken with my full-frame DSLR.

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/pro-choice.webp\" alt=\"pro-choice\" /></p>\n<p>When I was in high-school, I took Speech as an elective my senior year, thinking it would be an easy credit. I've never been shy. I thought my vocabulary was good enough to serve me adequately. I knew little about debate, extemporaneous speaking, expository speaking and the other forms of competition. A good portion of the course was taken up by the study of semantics, the study of meaning in language, including the interpretation of words, sentences, and text in context. It's a key component of understanding how linguistic signs and symbols convey specific concepts and ideas. I grokked it immediately. The class turned out to be a lot of fun. Although I didn't win any awards at the speech competitions we went to, I got a lot from the class. My formal education ended when I was 18, so I've had to make the most out of what I learned back then.</p>\n<p>When I got involved in political activism and went through training to talk to people about issues, I learned how good the conservative movement had been at choosing the words to frame their positions on things. The prime example is the abortion issue. By calling their stance \"pro-life\" they assumed the moral high-ground. Who could be against life? The left has tried to label them as anti-choice and anti-abortion but their movement is still known by the name they choose for it. They did the same thing during the early stages of the Affordable Care Act debate when they coined the named \"Death Panels.\" Most reflexive opponents of the act could not tell what exactly a death panel's job was, they just knew that Democrats wanted to kill them. Politicians worldwide use framing. The Brexit \"leave\" crowd made their argument about taking back control, emphasizing sovereignty and immigration limits.</p>\n<p>The left has had some success with framing as well. One of the reasons that Dr. King was successful is the way he framed the struggle for civil rights in the context of American values like freedom and equality. People advocating for vaccines do better when they present their case that by getting vaccinated, you are protecting your loved ones rather than just giving survival stats.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, people in tech take ownership over phrases that were once used as pejoratives, like laying claim to the titles geek and nerd.  Most people with blogs choose to call themselves bloggers rather than writer as not to appear pretentious, even if they are, in fact, fantastic writers.</p>\n<p>I love language. Sometimes I've had a hard time putting into practice that it's not what you say, but how you say it. It's been a 60-year learning process, but I am getting there.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

When I&#39;m reading a book, watching a\nmovie or listening to music, if I come across a line I want to remember\nI write it down. Years ago, the developers at Lickability made an app\ncalled Quotebook for iOS that was specifically designed for quote\ncollectors, but it was removed from the App Store in 2016 - although for\nanyone who still has a copy it is fully functional in iOS 18!</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve looked all over for a suitable replacement, and the closest I&#39;ve\nfound is <a\nhref=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/quotemarks-quote-notebook/id1327090189\">Quotemarks</a>\nfrom indy developer Christopher Hale. It is a free app with an IAP just\nto leave a tip. Quotemarks is great because it lets you import your\ncollection from a CSV file. Anyone who already has a collection is saved\nfrom having to manually enter their quotes. The fields you can import\ninclude:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Quote</li>\n<li>Author</li>\n<li>Tag</li>\n<li>Notes</li>\n<li>Date Added</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I wish there was a field for the source, but you can use the notes field\nfor that. Of course, you can add new quotes you find one at the time\nwithin the app.</p>\n\n<p>Some nice touches with the program include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Automatic import of images of well-known authors</li>\n<li>Links to the bios of authors on Wikipedia</li>\n<li>Select the style of quotation marks to use (including none)</li>\n<li>Backup and restore</li>\n<li>Schedule quotes to appear on certain days in a widget</li>\n<li>Use the share sheet to export quotes</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Quotemarks is an iOS app that runs in Macs with M-series chips. If you\nhave an Intel Mac you will have to use it on an iPhone or iPad.</p>\n\n<p>If you are looking for quotes to use with the app or for your own\npersonal collection, I have <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/cyclelou/Amerpie\">shared my collection on\nGitHub</a> as either a ZIP file or in individual Markdown notes readable\nby any text editor or for use in Obsidian.</p>\n\n<p>I am not the developer. I don&#39;t know the developer. if you gave\nquestions or suggestions, you can contact him using the information <a\nhref=\"https://quotemarks.app/\">on his website.</a></p>\n\n<p>Another good quotes manager is <a\nhref=\"https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/thoughts-inspiration-manager\">Thoughts\n- Inspiration Manager.</a></p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Quotemarks - Quote Notebook' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

None of it is too big a deal. The info will be yours to do with what you want. Let's get started.</p>\n<p>First, I want to ask you to be nice to new folks when they enter a community. Every so often they don't know the unwritten rules under which we operate. Believe it or not, there are still grown adults who don't have much social media experience. Can you imagine how much courage it takes to get involved with us, considering our reputation? Just say hi to them and if they need constructive criticism, do it gently or offer it in a private message. If they ask questions that have easy answers, teach them how to fish by telling them how and where to look things up instead of being snarky and asking them if they ever heard of Google. </p>\n<p>Let's all take steps this year to curate our experience. Let's try to use the tools that filter the stuff that stresses us out. Don't feed the trolls when it is so much easier to just block and hide them forever. If someone you have a relationship with has a bad hot take, maybe don't throw the baby out with the bath water. Give them a second chance. Perhaps even forgive them. If, instead, you discover that they have some disqualifying belief system, well, that's a different story. No one is going to ask you to be friends with bigots for the sake of harmony. Have standards and stick to them.</p>\n<p>Try coming up with a helpful project this year. Hell, if it takes up too much time, charge a fee. I look at things like Robb Knight's <a href='https://echofeed.app'>Echofeed</a> and <a href='https://slashpages.net'>Slash Pages,</a> or the <a href='https://blogprompts.fyi'>blog prompts</a> from Scott Jones. Jedda and I started <a href='https://blogroll.club'>Blogroll.club</a>. You could write <a href='https://library.bearblog.dev'>book reviews</a> like Alexandra or <a href='https://isfeeling.social/@matt/113507853951324610?ref=birchtree.me'>movie reviews</a> like Matt Birchler. Try writing a tutorial on something you are good at. Make<a href='https://amerpie.lol/my-bookmarks/'>a weekly list of bookmarks</a> to share with people. You can do this.</p>\n<p>Lastly, be an advocate for the people who need advocates. You know exactly who I am talking about. It has become acceptable in this country to demonize and denigrate people who don't match the profile of the typical voter belonging to the majority party. We have a president-elect who told four members of the house, all women of color, to go back where they came from - and he wasn't talking about Minnesota and the Bronx. Members of the LGBT community are constantly being harassed and accused of things they don't do. The people who gather our food, mow our lawns, build our houses, process our meat and more are being terrorized by threats. Honest journalists who tell us when the emperor has no clothes are being threatened by the incoming FBI director. Even common people are being labeled as enemies from within for not being real Americans. Don't stand for any of it. Don't be silent. Silence favors the oppressor.</p>\n<p>I appreciate you taking the time to read this letter. If you have any questions, just ask.</p>\n<p>Lou<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/70s.webp\" alt=\"70s\" /></p>\n<p>Starting with the 1960s, I have now lived in or through seven different decades. I don't have many memories of the supposed decade of love other than the first moon landing and the ongoing war in Vietnam. From 1970 onward, all kinds of things are stuck in my mind. I've always had preternatural ability to remember facts and facts both from my own life and from the world at large as I've experienced it vicariously through the media.</p>\n<p>Before I get into my favorite decade, let me first dissect my least favorite, that being the aughties, 2000-2009. The first year was marred by the Supreme Court essentially appointing everyone's favorite nepo baby frat boy as President of the United States. The year after that, the US was attacked by 19 Saudi Arabian terrorists, something that caused us to go to war with two countries that are not Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan.  Gratuitous flag waving and war fever led to reelecting the frat boy, thousands of military dead and trillions of dollars wasted. About the only good thing to come out of the decade were some killer TV shows like The Sopranos and The Wire.</p>\n<p>The ten-year span that I liked the best in the sense of it being an era was the 1970s. That’s the time period that saw me go from kindergarten age to high school. The music from the 70s has never been equaled in the rock era. Seminal albums from Led Zeppelin, The Who, The Rolling Stones and Carole King all came out in just one year, 1971. Many classic movies were released, including The Godfather, Rocky and Star Wars. Television classics like Roots, All in the Family and MASH played on over the air TV. In sports we had two Olympics that gave us stars like Mark Spitz and Sugar Ray Leonard. Baseball saw the Yankees return to prominence. Football saw great seasons by the Dolphins and Steelers among others.</p>\n<p>Politically we saw the system work when Richard Nixon was forced to resign. Congress finally extended oversight over the FBI and CIA, ending decades of abuse. The draft and the Vietnam War ended. The nation elected an honorable man president in 1976.</p>\n<p>The 70s were not perfect. There were tragedies like Kent State and the Greensboro Massacre. Inflation was rampant throughout the decade. The Iranian hostage crisis happened. Still, the US memorably celebrated its Bicentennial. By the end of the decade most of the last vestiges of segregation were gone.</p>\n<p>I’m a personal fan of the current decade too but more for internal reasons than external ones. I’m happy the US isn’t at war. I’m happy that the biggest sports star in the US is Caitlyn Clark, a 22-year-old woman. It sucks that 14 out of 15 of the year’s biggest movies were sequels.

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/44-1.webp\" alt=\"Jimmy Carter wearing an Allman Brothers t-shirt\" /></p>\n<p>I was 11 years old in 1976 when Jimmy Carter was running for president the first time. He had been the governor of Georgia, a state that borders my own (NC). All I had ever known about US presidents was that they were either bad people (Nixon) or boring (Ford). Carter was exciting. He was nice and famous for his big smile. He had been a farmer like my grandparents, who loved him.</p>\n<p>During the Carter era my brother, sister and I traveled through Georgia with my grandparents to two shrines for Southern Democrats. The first was Warm Springs where FDR often vacationed to seek relief from the pain in his polio stricken limbs and where he died in 1944. The second shine was Plains, Jimmy Carter's home town where his somewhat ne-er-do-well brother Billy operated a gas station and his mother, Miss Lillian lived.</p>\n<p>Richard Nixon was the first president I was aware of. I started reading newspapers as soon as I could read and my initial encounters with the political press were during the Watergate era. Not only were stories about the corruption in the Republican party always in the paper, the Watergate hearings were held broadcast live on every channel and like the geeky little kid I was, I watched them. I remember when Nixon resigned and how happy and relieved the adults in my were.</p>\n<p>Life in America in the late 70s was rough. Inflation was as high as it had ever been. It started creeping upward during the Ford administration but it really skyrocketed after a while. The after affects of the Arab oil embargo were still having a dramatic affect on life in the US. Unpopular mandates like the 55 mph speed limit and the voluntary reduction of home heating use was implemented. Then the Iranians took over the US embassy in Tehran and took the staff hostage, triggering a crisis and <a href='https://theintercept.com/2023/03/24/october-surprise-ben-barnes/'>eventually collusion with none other than Ronald Reagan.</a> Yeah - that Ronald Reagan - the same one who started selling the Iranians weapons just a few years later.</p>\n<p>I don't remember people disparaging President Carter during those years. Life was tough, but people believed that he cared, that he was facing problems head on and that he had a very hard job in very hard times. Most people felt like he had done a lot for world peace when he facilitated the Camp David Accords that resulted in a peace between Israel and Egypt that has lasted until this day.</p>\n<p>Ted Kennedy, blind to the anything but his own personal ambition challenged an incumbent president from his own party in the 1980 election. Carter defeated him and polled well against Reagan until shortly before the election, being weighed down my Iran, primarily.</p>\n<p>In the years since 1980, Carter has nearly achieved sainthood - a tough go for a Southern Baptist. It became fashionable to classify his presidency as a failure, although most people who repeat that have a difficult time articulating why or defending any reasons they put forth. Instead, we got the union busting, inflation riddled, tax-cutting for the rich, budget ballooning, arms to Iran puppet of the right-wing, Ronald Ray-Gun.</p>\n<p>Since Jimmy Carter left the white house, his basic goodness and humanity has never, ever wavered. He has represented the US admirably and performed with unmatched wisdom in advocating for world health improvements that have saved millions of lives. The pictures of him volunteering for Habitat for Humanity into his 90s are famous.</p>\n<p>I'm sad tonight to know that I'm going to be on a planet without Jimmy Carter on it for the first time ever.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

All of that came crashing to a halt in 2024 when the\noriginal developer cashed out and sold the app to new owners without\nanyone immediately disclosing the sale. Because menu mar managers like\nBartender require screen recording permissions, security minded users\nwere justifiably alarmed but the tin foil hat brigade lost their minds.\nAll kinds of nefarious plots and schemes were pitched (the commies,\nspyware, price increases, subscriptions and more). Some people even\naccused the new owners of counterfeiting messages from the original dev.\nTelemetry was briefly introduced and then removed, sparking more\ntin-foil hattery. </p>\n\n<p>Outside of the Reddit and perpetually online bubble, Bartender remained\npopular. On Setapp, the subscription app service with 1 million users,\nit is the number one most downloaded app. The reason for this is simple.\nBartender is great, and it has been through several versions. I&#39;ve used\nit non-stop for over a decade. I have over 40 menu bar apps running most\nof the time and it manages them without a hitch. The program is under\nactive development and even more features are on the way.</p>\n\n<h2>What Makes Bartender So Good</h2>\n\n<p>Like other menu bar managers, Bartender allows you to select what is\nvisible on your screen during normal operations. With a click on the\nBartender menu, you can see a secondary display of icons, called the\nBartender bar, which can also be summoned through a variety of user\ndefined actions. You can also specify that certain icons never appear in\neither the menu bar or the Bartender bar.</p>\n\n<p>Bartender allows you to make a number of aesthetic changes to the\nappearance of the menu bar, including borders, colors and corners.</p>\n\n<p>You can create multiple presets containing different configuration of\nicons if you want to show and hide icons depending on your workflow. Any\nof those presets can contain groups of icons, basically a submenu. I\ngroup all of my cloud services into one of these.</p>\n\n<p>Bartender can automatically load a preset using triggers. The current\ntriggers are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Battery - trigger when on battery power or charging, or at a specific level.</li>\n<li>WiFi - trigger when connected/not connected to a WiFi network. Or when connected to a specific network</li>\n<li>Location - trigger when at a specific location.</li>\n<li>Time/Date - schedule when to trigger</li>\n<li>Icon Appearance - useful for icons like VPNs that change appearance when connected</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You can choose icon spacing using three categories: normal spacing,\nsmall spacing, no spacing.</p>\n\n<p>There is a search feature that lets you bring any of your menu bar icons\ninto view. You can open it from the Bartender menu or from a hotkey.</p>\n\n<p>If you would like to test Bartender, you can get a four week free trial\nat <a href=\"https://macbartender.com/\">the app&#39;s website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you are still not convinced, but you need a menu bar manager, here\nare some more options&quot;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://icemenubar.app/\">Ice</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hidden-bar/id1452453066?mt=12\">HiddenBar</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/barbee-hide-menu-bar-items/id1548711022?mt=12\">Barbee</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://matthewpalmer.net/vanilla/\">Vanilla</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Bartender - Still Best in Class' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/linkage/img_8210.webp\" alt=\"Book Cover\" /></p>\n<p>Thirty years ago, writer John Berendt published a surprise non-fiction book that ended up spending a near record 216 weeks on The New York Times best seller list. The book was <em>Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil</em>, an account of the multiple trials of Jim Williams, a Savannah, Georgia antique dealer and a member of the local high society. Williams killed a local male prostitute in the study of Mercer House. The book's main character isn't really Williams. It is the Georgia city along with a variety of eccentric individuals.</p>\n<p>My personal favorite was The Lady Chablis, a local transgender woman and well known club entertainer. She went on to play herself in Clint Eastwood's 1997 film version of the story.</p>\n<p>Also featured in the book and the movie is Emma Kelly, a musician known as the Lady of 6,000 songs, so named by famous composer, Jonny Mercer. He couldn't name a song she couldn't play. He estimated that she knew 6K.</p>\n<p>Minerva, a Gullah woman and renowned root doctor was the name given in the book and movie for a character based on Valerie Boles. She served as a conduit of local knowledge for Jim Williams during his trials.</p>\n<p>The book was a delight to plow through . At times it reads like a novel but Berendt swears it is 99% true and 1% exaggeration. The film was not a hit, but I enjoyed it as well. John Cusack played one of his best roles in it.  This weekend (December 28-29, 2024) I'm making my first trip Savannah with plans to see many of the locations described in the book.</p>\n<p><a href='https://clubone-online.com/ladychablis/'>Lady Chablis </a></p>\n<p><a href='https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0119668/'>Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil (1997) ⭐ 6.6 | Crime, Drama, Mystery</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://www.amazon.com/Midnight-Garden-Good-Evil-Savannah/dp/0679751521?dplnkId=a457a685-cea9-493c-a6a0-e0bd6f4afabd&amp;nodl=1'>Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil: A Savannah Story</a>\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

We traveled by car from our home in SE North Carolina down Interstate 95 to what will hopefully turn out to be the lovely city of Savannah, Georgia. I didn't even have to drive. I didn't have to navigate. The only thing I had to do was avoid irritating Wonder Woman, who had to fight with stop and go traffic for hours. What should have taken about three and a half hours instead took nearly six. We got off and on the Interstate more than once trying to find a less congested route to no avail.</p>\n<p>Honestly, I didn't have it too bad, I wrote a couple of blog posts and half listened to some ultrarunning podcasts, while Wonder Woman, who ran 15 miles just before we left home, tried to find a comfortable sitting position for an aching hip with little success. I'd offered to drive but she elected not to take me up on the offer, not that I was insistent.</p>\n<p>What little we saw of our destination city was nice. We are staying in the historic district. The streets are lined with giant old hardwoods. There are park like squares close by and many, many highly rated restaurants nearby. We had to cross the Eugene Talmedge Bridge over the Savannah River to get into town. I don't know what it is about Southern cities keeping the names of devout segregationists on public landmarks. Talmedge, who was governor in the 30s and 40s, pursued openly racist objectives such as restoring the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_primary' title='White primary'>white primary</a> and enforcing segregation of the state universities. The bridge was built in 1991, and they named it for a sorry old cracker. That's a shame.</p>\n<p>We plan to tour the city with a special side excursion to Bonaventure Cemetery. We are also going to load up on Dramamine and go out for a boat ride in hopes of encountering dolphins. Wonder Woman will undoubtably run from one end of town to the other. I'll look for stuff to write about. We will be recovered from the car ride from hell tomorrow, I'm sure.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/47-3.webp\" alt=\"Identity\" /></p>\n<p>I often wonder \"Why am I like this?\" and \"Why do I feel this way? \" Those aren't the most original questions. Philosophers and psychologists have been pondering them and attempting to answer them for a long time. Trying to figure out if it's nature (hereditary) or nurture (environment) can be a fun parlor game. Alternatively, the truly curious folks, who also have good insurance or a lot of money can undergo analysis in any one of several flavors, Freudian, Jungian and so forth. </p>\n<p>I'd really like to know how I ended up such a political outlier. Both of my parents are Republicans, although my Mother was a Nixon despising liberal until she married a conservative a few years after I left home. Despite living in a red state, never attending college, serving in the military and working in manufacturing, plus being straight, white and cis-male, I'm an AOC, Bernie Sanders type, a loud one. </p>\n<p>Some parts of who I am are definitely genetically influenced. Alcoholism, unfortunately, is a problem that's affected people in my family for more than just a single generation. Luckily for them, my siblings have a STOP button and can drink moderately or not at all when they choose. For me, only total abstinence from everything mood altering has been the only solution. I've never been bitter or jealous about it, though. I just didn't win the genetic lottery.</p>\n<p>As anyone who reads this blog with any regularity knows, I consider myself to be the luckiest married man on the face of the earth. I absolutely lucked out when I met my wife. I was 47 and did not have a good track record when it came to maintaining a happy home life. Somehow, though, the two of us have not had a difficult time staying enamored of one another. We spend every possible minute together, and each of us takes care of the other in different ways. How, so late in life, did I acquire the skill to be happily married year after year?</p>\n<p>Despite being an average student, I've always performed well on standardized tests. I failed half the math classes I took in high school but scored as high on the SAT as friends who got into engineering school. It was test scores and charm (or manipulation my Mom called it when she was mad) that allowed me to participate in programs for gifted kids in school, not my grades. My only contribution to my own mental development has been an insatiable life-long love of reading and being curious about a long list of things. My brother and sister also had great test scores, but they backed them up with good grades and post graduate studies at flagship universities. Our parents, the children of farmers, both have degrees now, but they didn't get them until their 30s. I tell my wife that I used to be smarter because I scored lower on mental acuity tests given to me in rehab than the ones I took as a teenager. In any case, I was blessed genetically with thinking skills I certainly didn't work for.</p>\n<p>There are numerous other characteristics I'd like to have more insight into. I have the skills of an extrovert but the disposition of an introvert. What's that about? Like many, many people in recovery, my preferred sports (before my knees gave out) were all endurance based. Why? Why am I a procrastinator? What makes me go from calm to irate in a nanosecond, but only once or twice a year? I'll probably never get satisfactory answers to those questions, but I'll be OK with that. It will just give me something to think about.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

It finds identical files if\nthe content, file extension and file size are the same regardless of the\nfile name. It has built in safeguards which prevent you from using the\nprogram to delete all copies of a file. To use it, you specify the\ndirectories you want to scan before initiating a scan. It has a function\nto auto-select all duplicates in a folder; however, this failed to work\nfor me during testing. Deleted files are removed from disk, not sent to\nthe trash. The program does not scan Apple Photo libraries. You need to\nuse other tools for that task.</p>\n\n<p>Within the app, you can preview files and get size, path and file name\ninformation.

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/keyboard.webp\" alt=\"Keyboard\" /></p>\n<p>I recently gave a bi<a href='https://linkage.lol/read-annie-s-blog-if-you-want-to-feel-good/'>g shoutout to my Internet friend, Annie</a> on my links blog. The tag line for her Mastodon account is one of my favorite series of consecutive words on the Internet. \"Wtf’ing every day, I’m basically a professional now.\" Every time I read that, I'm like, me too sister, me too. There is just so much about the world and about people's motivations that I just do not get. Here are a few examples.</p>\n<h2 id=very-expensive-restaurants>Very Expensive Restaurants</h2><p>I like to eat. You can take one look at me and figure that out without trying too hard. I also like to go out to eat because cooking is one of my chores and having someone else do it is a real treat. Furthermore, we are relatively debt free and have a comfortable income. Having established all that, I have no desire to frequent the most expensive places, either in town or on vacation. I feel absolutely pampered with a meal that costs between <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mn>20</mn><mo>&#x02212;</mo></mrow></math>30 dollars. Anything over that makes me feel like I'm throwing money away. Nothing, absolutely nothing, tastes that good. I don't care how fancy the inside of the establishment happens to be or where it is located. I like good service. Tipping well is a sign of good morals, and wait staff deserve to make a living wage. I just don't want to cough up 40 or 50 dollars to a server for a party of two (which I will do if the bill calls for it) because they work at a fancy joint when the waitress at Golden Corral busts her butt for a fraction of that. It doesn't make sense.</p>\n<h2 id=mechanical-keyboards>Mechanical Keyboards</h2><p>My first computer was an IBM PC with a loud, heavy mechanical keyboard. It was in the days when we were all trained to die of thirst rather than risk spilling a Coke on our precious computer peripherals. These days I type a lot. I'm on a computer many, many hours a day. I have a definite preference for all my tech needs, but I've never once considered going back to the 80s or 90s experience for my keyboard needs. I don't like loud. I don't like heavy. I don't like expensive. I don't like dumb.</p>\n<h2 id=voting-against-ones-own-interest>Voting Against One's Own Interest</h2><p>When I see working-class people with Trump stickers on their cars, I wonder what their motivation is. Republican policies are undoubtedly hostile to average Americans. Huge cuts are made to social programs, education, health care and public services to cut taxes for corporations and the 1%. There is no demonstrable benefit to middle and lower income voters from GOP policies. The incoming administration wants to cut veterans benefits for all the working-class men and women who served in the costly Republican wars of the early 21st century. GOP senators are publishing op/ed pieces on how badly they would like to cut social security and medicare. Literally WTF is anyone with a mortgage and a car payment doing supporting these predatory plutocrats?</p>\n<h2 id=refusing-to-learn-21st-century-skills>Refusing to Learn 21st Century Skills</h2><p>I am continuing my recent campaign against technological illiteracy in the 21st century. I stepped on plenty of toes recently by mocking people who type GOOGLE into Google when they want to search for something. People told me it was none of my business and that it didn't hurt anything, and I came back at them with both barrels. Billions of dollars are lost every year in lost productivity because people with a proven educational track record of having the ability to learn are not held accountable for pretending to be stupid when it comes to using a computer. When automobiles adopt new technology, people learn how to use it. When you have to use a touch screen at Bojangles to get a sausage biscuit, people figure it out. Why can't they remember to restart their computer when they have a problem? What can't they learn how to find a file on their PC? No one makes them, that's why. Institutions would rather pay an IT department to hold the hands of otherwise competent adults than they would enforce basic tech competency on the workforce.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

When interactive white boards\narrived, incorporating connected computers for use instead of grease\npencils and plastic, it felt like the future, but the high cost of the\neasily damaged devices coupled with the need for projectors using\nreplaceable bulbs eventually left schools looking for a better\nalternative, which in most cases is a cheap, large screen television\nconnected via HDMI.

When we arrived, we spent about an hour visiting and giving reports on various family members. We also opened gifts. We gave mom a puzzle from her favorite company, one of several she received. She gave me a tech widget from my wish list (a dual hard drive bay). Wonder Woman got running socks from her preferred company, Injinji and a new robe. This morning I got up and hung out with Mom, answering tech questions, while Wonder Woman went on her run. When she returned, Mom made shrimp and grits, a Christmas tradition. She told us that she's been buying local shrimp from the same fisherman's family for 44 years.</p>\n<p>We set out after breakfast to the home of my daughter and her family, a four and a half hour trip. As usual, Wonder Woman drove while I completed a couple of blog posts while we listened to various ultrarunning podcasts. I also may have taken a nap. I'm not sure. The weather was clear, and the sun was bright as we made our away across North Carolina's coastal plain and into the Piedmont. </p>\n<p>When we arrived, we unloaded gifts and carried them to the door, where my six-year-old grandson was delighted to see us. We spent the day visiting and responding to messages from our other kids and grandkids. We got a video of the youngest granddaughter, who was happy to demonstrate to her mother that yes, Santa will indeed bring more than one gift if you ask. Our oldest granddaughter gave the whole family a gift by waiting until today to announce that she had been accepted to her first choice for college, Mary Washington University in Virginia. </p>\n<p>We had one scare. Our grandson who has mobility issues, took a spill today and had to go to the emergency room. Luckily, the wait was not too bad, and he didn't break anything, so it worked out mostly OK. He's a stoic guy. One of the funniest moments of the holiday happened yesterday when he and I were in the living room of my mother-in-law's house. I thought I overheard Wonder Woman telling the story of one of my less than stellar moments from the kitchen, where she was making giant pans of lasagna with her sister. I asked my grandson, \"Is you Nana talking junk about me in there?\" He didn't crack a smile, but there was a gleam in his eye as he gave me three very solemn nods to affirm my suspicions.</p>\n<p>Like many folks at my age, my greatest joy during the holidays is enjoying my family. A day like today was just about perfect. We had a fantastic Christmas dinner. We discussed the past and the future and laughed and laughed. My granddaughter made delicious deserts that fit everyone's diet requirements. For Wonder Woman and my daughter, that means gluten-free. For me, it just means that there is room on my plate.</p>\n<p>In the coming days, I'll visit with my Dad to help him with some end of year computer tasks. I have family visiting from out of state, tickets for the new Bob Dylan biopic and reservations for a getaway in Savannah, Georgia before the New Year. My heart is full and I lack for nothing. Wherever you are, I hope you had the holiday you wanted and a time to enjoy whatever you enjoy. Merry Christmas from Wonder Woman and I!<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

The message contains a URL to a map with an icon\nrepresenting the locale of the sender. Although there is a paid option\nfor organizations and commercial enterprises, the basic application is\nfree and sufficient for the typical user. </p>\n\n<p>To use Glympse, you use your contacts or enter a phone number, or\nmultiple numbers. There is a space for a short message, e.g., &quot;On the\nway&quot;.  You choose the length of time to share your location and\noptionally, your destination. </p>\n\n<p>You can save numbers and contacts in the Glympse app if you frequently\ncommunicate with the same people. For instance, I have my mom and\ndaughter saved in the app since they both live a few hours away. If\ncontacts both have Glympse installed, they can use the app to request\nthat another user share their location. </p>\n\n<p>Glympse also allows the creation of private groups. &quot;Glympse Private\nGroups is a feature of the Glympse app that creates a private,\ninvite-only Glympse Group. Members of a Group can share their location\nto and request the location (within the group) of other members. Any\nmember of the group can see the location of everyone that is actively\nsharing within the group. They are perfect for sharing with family,\ncarpool, teams, or a group of friends. The Group is private and not\naccessible by others, unless they are signed in to Glympse, and have\nreceived an invite from an existing member.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Then there are public groups. &quot;Glympse Public Tags is a feature of the\nGlympse app that allows you to quickly view and share your location with\nmultiple people on a single, shared Glympse map. Anyone who knows your\nGlympse Public Tag name can view the tag map and add themselves to the\nmap. When you view a tag map, what you are seeing is a map of people who\nhave chosen to join the Glympse Public Tag map.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve used Glympse for years. I find it simple and easy to use for even\ntechnically challenged folks. </p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Glympse Location Sharing - Free and Secure' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

I may start writing more reviews of iOS apps to mix things up. I've thought for months that'd I'd stockpile some posts or at least some ideas, but nope. Every day is a blank sheet of paper. I just come up with topics at the last minute. I need to keep better records, because I've duplicated myself a couple of times.</p>\n<h2 id=tech>Tech</h2><p>In the past 12 months, I've updated all my Apple tech: laptop, iPhone, iPad and watch. I'm going to have to come up with a fancy excuse to get anything major in 2025. I'd love to get a Mac Mini or another machine to set up as a self-hosting device and/or Plex server. Unlike a lot of people, I operate solely from a laptop at home with no external monitor or keyboard. Wonder Woman would beat me to death if I insisted on setting up a desk in another room.</p>\n<h2 id=as-a-citizen>As a Citizen</h2><p>I will continue to be an outspoken and vocal critic of the MAGA movement in every possible venue. I will not let pro-Trump speech go unchallenged in my presence. I'm not going to obsess over the news or watch the daily clown show, but I will stay informed. I will financially support civil liberties organizations</p>\n<h2 id=professionally>Professionally</h2><p>My goal at work is to continue to show up as long as it's tolerable. I had to deal with a couple of crazy rude staff members this year. Time will tell if the administration adequately dealt with that behavior or if it will be culturally tolerated. I'm there to help people. I enjoy it, but I'm way past the point in my life where I have to deal with nutjobs.</p>\n<h2 id=travel>Travel</h2><p>I have a standing offer to go to the Alps with Wonder Woman, but I have to up my walking ability first. She knows my mountain climbing days are behind me but she wants me to be able to go for walks along river banks and around lake sides.  I'd also like to make a trip to Austin where my son lives.\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

I started off sporadically, mostly writing about tech. I eventually began reviewing apps, something I still do - every single day for the last 265 days. In March I branched out into more personal, autobiographical stuff. Because that still wasn't enough to keep me busy, and because I got a free domain name, I started a links blog in June to share the interesting things I find online, hoping to find other people who are interested in similar things. I didn't have any idea if what I had to say would click with anyone. Lot's of people I follow on Mastodon are comp sci majors involved in advanced development and I'm just a guy who hangs out in the server room. I also started blogging immediately after discovering the current iteration of the indyweb, without spending any time learning the culture or the unwritten rules. In the end, everything worked out. The developer folks with the giant brains appreciate hearing about cool apps. The indyweb at large seems to have one over arching rule, try to be a good person.</p>\n<p>Based on Mastodon comments, emails and some rudimentary analytics, these are the posts that resonated the most with people this year..</p>\n<p><a href='https://louplummer.lol/non-toxic-masculinity/'>Non-Toxic Masculinity</a> - My most widely read post was about my journey as an adult to redefine was masculinity means.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When I was younger, I was attracted to traditional masculine roles and activities. I played high school football. I enlisted in the infantry. My first civilian job after that was working in a men's prison. It's not that I now feel like any of those are bad things, necessarily, but I don't need all that testosterone fueled chest thumping and the intimidation and violence that go with them in order to feel like I'm a real man, whatever that means.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href='https://louplummer.lol/the-perfect-blogger/'>The Perfect Blogger</a> I like to wite about the experience of being a part of this community and y'all seem to like to read about it. This post got a lot of reaction.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It's not that I want to see myself in every blogger, quite the contrary. I want to read women bloggers, trans bloggers, POC, millennials, Gen Z, international writers. I want to make my world bigger.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href='https://louplummer.lol/my-partner/'>My Partner</a> - It really made me happy that people liked this appreciation piece I wrote about Wonder Woman, my wife, Carol.  I frequently mention her and I wanted folks to know why. I think I succeeded.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>She has good genes does my wife. She is a careful eater and a devout exerciser. In her late 50s with 13 grandchildren, she doesn't appear to have aged a day from when I met her at a hundred-mile bicycle ride in 2011</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The most popular posts from my links blog were ones I compiled of topics that the blogging community appreciates.</p>\n<p><a href='https://linkage.lol/for-linkblog-fans/'>For Linkblog Fans</a> - a collection of places where folks share the best of the Interent with each other</p>\n<p><a href='https://linkage.lol/omglol-is-the-best-thing-on-the-internet/'>OMG.LOL is the Best Thing on the Internet</a> - the home of my Mastodon instance, /now page and about page is awesome and if you don't have an omg.lol account, you should.</p>\n<p><a href='https://linkage.lol/some-advice-on-not-drinking/'>Some Advice on Not Drinking</a> - This was a no-judgment zone with some practical advice for anyone who wants to avoid alcohol for a night or for a lifetime, written from the heart.</p>\n<p>For my fellow App Addicts, these were the most widely read reviews from 2024. People were really curious about these programs. This blog by far is the one people read the most with 280,000 hits since March.  I'm happy to have the experience of writing for a wide audience and to share my hobby and experience with the world.

If you are\ncollecting a list of apps to share on Reddit or links for a blog post,\nnews letter or bibliography, this is a great tool to have.</p>\n\n<p>You can add links to Bridges through the share sheet or the program&#39;s\ninterface. When you save a link, you can accept the default title or\ncreate one of your own. Links are saved into folders which are housed in\ncollections for a more granular differentiation. In the Bridges\ninterface, you see a rich preview of the page, its favicon and hero\nimage. It is possible to preview the entire saved page within the app.</p>\n\n<p>When you&#39;re ready to export links, you can do it one at the time or by\nfolder. The export choices are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Hyperlink</li>\n<li>Markdown</li>\n<li>JSON</li>\n<li>HTML</li>\n<li>URL</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There is also an iOS app for Bridges (priced separately) and all the\ndata resides in a shared secure iCloud folder and syncs between devices.\nBridges is $1.99 on the <a\nhref=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bridges-link-formatting/id6466660721?mt=12\">Mac\nApp Store.</a></p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Bridges Link Sharing' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

Don't @ me.</strong></p>\n<p>I will admit to being mostly ignorant of pop culture, mostly because of avoidance. I don't think I've watched a network television show since season 2 of Survivor, and that's been more than twenty years ago. Furthermore, I haven't listened to a commercial radio station by my choice since high school. I was excited when Christopher Reeves made the first Superman movie in the 80s, but I've just about totally opted out of the entire Marvel Comic Universe. This means I've missed most, if not all, the top-grossing movies of all time.</p>\n<p>I'm not a total cultural Luddite. We subscribe to most of the streaming channels and regularly watch them, but I opt for as much British TV as I can get (but not Doctor Who). I never watch the Superbowl or the World Series or the NBA Finals. The best I can do is catch a few stages of the Tour de France every July. I recently saw Gladiator 2 and today, Wonder Woman bought us tickets to see the new Bob Dylan biopic starring that kid they hold lookalike contests to match.</p>\n<p>I rarely read books published within the last year unless I receive one as a gift. Beyond that, I love to read book reviews and keep up with what's hot but surfing the Internet has ruined my concentration skills and sitting still with a novel is just an advanced form of torture these days. I find a lot of modern fiction to be pretentious and difficult to read anyway. I'd rather stick with golden age science fiction or a good detective novel.I enjoy non-fiction, but that's hardly pop culture, is it?</p>\n<p>What interests me not at all is celebrity news and gossip. I do not care one whit who is married to whom. I might pay attention if one of them says something political, just to make sure I don't give a conservative any of my money or brain space. So yes, I know about James Woods, Jon Voight, Kelsey Grammar, and people like that. I don't like them. I like folks like Bruce Springsteen and Beyoncé who, although they probably have no clue anymore what regular people are like, are still loyal to us when it comes to our country's leadership.</p>\n<p>The closest I get to discovering new music is through Apple Music playlists. The genres I like are (other than classic rock) Americana, Alt-Country and Folk. Occasionally, they'll add in a group new to me or songs from after I stopped buying music, which was approximately 2006. Wonder Woman makes me listen to Nickelback and that red-headed English guy and various late-stage music that I occasionally enjoy, but not enough to learn anything about them.</p>\n<p>Don't try to talk to me about super-hero movies or any of the other franchise series like Mission Impossible of the one where Vin Diesel drives cars. My eyes will glaze over, and I will move away from you. I don't know anything about Harry Potter apart from that the woman who wrote the books is a TERF bully who picks on Olympic athletes. I can possibly name one or two people from YouTube (Mr. Beast and PewDiePie)and one from TikTok (Gerron, the funny Irish guy). These days, I hardly even know any podcasters because I no longer have a commute where I can listen to what they produce.</p>\n<p>I hope we can still be friends.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/crop.webp\" alt=\"crop\" /></p>\n<p>I cringe whenever I hear some uninformed person going on and on about how easy people in prison have it. “They have it made. They get three hots and a cot and free medical care!” Never mind all the danger, the loss of freedom and the monotony, one thing prison does is infantilize the incarcerated. It takes away many of the privileges of adulthood.</p>\n<p>When I was a kid, I wanted to be grown so badly. I loved talking to adults and hanging out with them when I could. Being an adult looked like the greatest thing in the world. You escaped from the dictatorship of your parents and your school, and you got to do whatever you want. I could not wait. I didn't even make it to the end of my senior year of high school under the umbrella of my family. Furthermore, I joined the military and left for basic training nine days after I graduated. Of course, that experience didn't involve a lot of freedom, but you definitely got treated like an adult. I got married a week after I finished that experience and by the end of the year, I had my own place, an income, and the freedom I always wanted.</p>\n<p>Of course, commensurate with freedom comes responsibility, but I'm feeling hedonistic tonight, so I am concentrating on the freedom aspect of it. The true freedom doesn't come until your kids are out of the house and self-supporting. In fact, I would say that true freedom doesn't really occur until near the end of your days as a wage slave.</p>\n<p>As I was nearing the end of my career, I'd been at my job for over a quarter of a century. I earned the maximum number of annual leave days each year that one can earn, and I never, ever, ever let any of those days go unused. I also had a huge number of sick days on the balance sheet. Every morning, I had the freedom to decide, “Do I want to go to work today?” I wasn't in the habit of abusing my privilege. I had people I cared about relying on me, but I knew in the back of my head that I could have a mental health day whenever I needed.</p>\n<p>Other wonderful adult privileges I appreciate to this day or deciding when I want to go to sleep and when I wish to wake up. I had an enforced bedtime past my 18th birthday, and I hated it. I love to read, and being able to continue a book at night in a dark house while everyone else is sleeping is just divine. Likewise, although I do have to be at work on time, I can still get up as early as I want to be on my computer or sleep until the last minute. Nobody is the boss of me! We have to be grateful for things like that after being mandated by parents, our children and other circumstances.</p>\n<p>Unlike prison inmates or soldiers, I can choose to wear whatever I want. I do the Steve Jobs thing where in public I go with the same style of pants and a black shirt every day. It's not a uniform, it's just easy, and I've been like that for years. At home, I opt for comfort and tend to hold on to shorts and sweatpants until they disintegrate. </p>\n<p>Oh — there's food too. I grew up in one of those “you have to eat everything on your plate” houses. There were only a few things I didn't care for, but my Mom made them anyway. I haven't had to eat a serving of green English peas since 1979. I'll never eat them again, either. I don't even have to worry about being a good example to my kids anymore. I can have cereal for supper and pizza for breakfast and no one is going to stop me because I am a gown-ass man and I can do what I want, and I love it.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

All it takes is $10 . You can set limits on your consumption if it makes you feel better, but it isn't needed. Once you set up an account, you can generate API keys to use with all kinds of software and services to use the advanced and any new models.

It was a\nheady time. The new computers we were purchasing were Bondi Blue first\ngeneration G3 iMacs. Having come from the PC world, I needed reference\nmaterial for all the new hardware I was being presented. One of my\nco-workers told me about <a href=\"https://mactracker.ca/\">MacTracker</a>\nand for the last quarter of a century I&#39;ve had a copy of this great app\ninstalled on every Mac I have ever owned or been assigned.</p>\n\n<p>MacTracker is a stand-alone hardware and software database of every Mac\nmodel that&#39;s even been made. It gives you info on:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>processor speed</li>\n<li>memory</li>\n<li>graphic cards</li>\n<li>supported OS versions</li>\n<li>price</li>\n<li>storage</li>\n<li>expansion options</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>MacTracker provides information on more than just laptops, desktops and\nservers. It also covers:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>iPhone</li>\n<li>iPad</li>\n<li>Apple Watch and</li>\n<li>Apple Vision Pro</li>\n<li>Newton</li>\n<li>Apple TV</li>\n<li>Apple accessories</li>\n<li>audio displays</li>\n<li>modems</li>\n<li>printers scanners</li>\n<li>storage</li>\n<li>Wi-Fi products</li>\n<li>operating systems</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you have even a passing interest in Mac history, you owe it to\nyourself to download and peruse this free app. If you are considering\ntinkering with vintage models, you definitely need this. The program\nlets you add computers to a section called &quot;My Models&quot; if you want to\ncompare the different Macs you own or have used. It has limited serial\nnumber lookups if you are unsure of the model you are working on. You\ncan link to MacTracker from other apps. Each model listed has\ninformation on whether it is considered still in support, vintage or\nobsolete.</p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=MacTracker - Can You Call Yourself a Fanboy If You Don't Have This Installed?' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/24-2.webp\" alt=\"Purple North Carolina\" /></p>\n<p>My online persona (which is the same persona I am IRL) is a man who loves three things: technology, his wife and social justice. I mention all three of those things with some frequency, although tech is the only thing I do much consistent long form writing about. Aside from an occasional blog post, my political discourse is usually in the form of memes or micro-posts of 300 words or fewer. I'm often speaking to an audience of fellow travelers, rather than trying to convert Hitler's children. I don't expect many conservative people to even read what I write unless we established a relationship around something else that is strong enough to survive my low opinion of the MAGA crowd.</p>\n<p>Mastodon is where I spend most of my social media time, having made nearly 6,500 posts since I joined in January. I cross post most of what I write to Facebook, Bluesky and Threads since I want to promote my writing to as big an audience as I can. I've been on Facebook for 16 years. I stay there mostly to keep in touch with family, although I have numerous friends because of a viral post I had in 2017. It's a horrible place run by a horrible man. <a href='https://louplummer.lol/why-im-still-on-facebook/'>I acknowledge that.</a> I hope that Bluesky continues to grow. It's a good place to interact with people outside the advanced tech and blogging crowd that I've met on Mastodon. I joined Threads on the first day, like 18 million other people. I spend very little time there because I don't like the algorithm. The posts I see are not interesting to me, and I don't have the time and energy to do much more than cross post there.</p>\n<p>Today, I made an observation about Elon Musk's growing influence over the Republican Party. He threatened a group of Republican House members if they supported a bi-partisan bill that the Speaker had agreed to that would have ended the budget stand-off. The bill contained disaster relief funds that are much needed in my home state, NC, which received $16 Billion is damage from a hurricane in October. What I wrote touched a nerve on both Meta platforms, and I had hundreds of people react and comment on it. </p>\n<p>Here's what I said — <strong>Elon Musk took actions yesterday that cancelled Hurricane Helene relief for Western North Carolina.</strong></p>\n<p>I got lots of support because as I said, most MAGAts long ago should have ignored me because of the vitriol I throw in their direction. Surprisingly, though, there were still plenty of offended people who Meta thought needed to read Lou Plummer's take on the Washington cesspool today.</p>\n<p>Their posts were just about all the same:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Nothing in Washington is Trump's fault because he hasn't taken office yet.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I made the whole thing up, and Musk did no such thing.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I am an idiot who believes what is reported by the media.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What was much worse were the nasty comments from Democrats who live in safe blue states. These people seem to think that 100% of the citizens of red states have Trump flags in their yards. They said things like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>It serves NC right because they voted for him</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I hope NC likes what they caused. I have no sympathy for any of them.</p>\n</li>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>What the hell? NC voted for Obama in 2008. We have a had a Democratic governor for the last eight years and just elected another one. The same goes for the attorney general's office and other statewide races. A lot of what has happened here is due to gerrymandering and voter suppression. Our GOP controlled legislature has passed numerous laws that have been overturned in the courts and backtracked on others, like the nation's first bathroom bill that cost the state billions of dollars in lost revenue because of boycotts.</p>\n<p>There are people who somehow think they have progressive values, yet have no sympathy or feelings of solidarity with those of us fighting the good fight in southern and rural states. I was mocked and ridiculed by them today, and it stung a bit. I don't give a shit what any Republican thinks of me, but I expected more from the stereotypical coastal elites than I got today. Not to belittle a point, but there is truly a difference between a progressive and a liberal. Today was not a good day for one of those groups.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

Some, like Instapaper and Pocket require you to create an\naccount and in return give you web access to your saved articles.\nOthers, like <a\nhref=\"https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/goodlinks\">Goodlinks</a> don&#39;t\nhave web access but offer you more privacy by syncing your saved\narticles through iCloud. A relatively new and rather elegant addition to\nthis space is <a\nhref=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flyleaf-read-later/id6475200381\">Flyleaf\nby Max Melzer.</a></p>\n\n<p>Flyleaf strips everything from web pages except the text of the article\nand images. It provides an interface similar to the Kindle experience by\npaginating articles and letting you move through them by swiping. If you\nprefer scrolling, you can turn the option off. For those into\naesthetics, Flyleaf has themes, some of which are behind a paywall. It\nalso lets you control the line spacing, font, margins and alignment\n(justified text or not).</p>\n\n<p>If you currently use Goodlinks, Instapaper or Later, you can import your\ncurrent collection into Flyleaf. Flyleaf also has an export feature to\nimport into other apps. Your list of saved articles has various display\noptions, including publication name, reading time, article image, and\nyour reading progress. You can choose to see just a list of titles or a\nlong or short summary of the article. For automation fans, Flyleaf has\nShortcuts and x-callback URL support. Articles in Flyleaf are\nsearchable. You can archive them when your done reading and also mark\nthem as favorites to find again quickly.</p>\n\n<p>Flyleaf is an iPad app that runs on Macs with Apple Silicon. If you gave\nan Intel machine, you&#39;ll have to use it on an iOS device.</p>\n\n<p>Everything in Flyleaf is free to use with two exceptions, extra themes\nand tagging. If you want those features, a subscription is required.\nIt&#39;s $2.00 mo/$17.00 yr, but in all honesty, those are such minor\nfeatures for most people that the primary reason for subscribing is to\nsupport the developer.</p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Flyleaf - An Elegant Read It Later Solution' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

It takes up time. It requires some concentration, but not enough to give you a headache. When you're done, you have something tangible to look at. I get my groove on not by stitching but by certain kinds of organizing. I'm sure Wonder Woman wishes my organizing preference were linen closets and so forth. It's not. This is not a post on making productivity your hobby.</p>\n<p>When I was growing up, I collected comic books and baseball cards. When it came to comics, I enjoyed three categories: Archie, Richie Rich and anything made by DC: Superman, Batman, The Flash, Green Lantern etc. My younger brother and I decided to have a joint collection. We'd spread comics on the floor and sort them by title and then by the individual number the publisher assigned to them. Some stacks were tall. Action Comics was where Superman got his start. It had been continuously in print since the 30s. Detective Comics, Batman's home, was the same way. Other stacks were much shorter, as superheroes would come and go. By the time we were in junior high school, we'd accumulated over 700 comic books, both from newsstands and many, many trips to used book stores. There weren't any comic shops in the places we lived. For me, though, all of that work came to a crashing halt in 1979 when my desire to escape my mother's wrath for misbehavior gave my brother leverage over me. He demanded my half of the comic collection in exchange for not narcing me out for smoking cigarettes. I gave in. He still has those comic books,  45 years later.</p>\n<p>I bought baseball cards until adulthood was well established. I had a giant tray that would hold hundreds of cards at the time, and I loved to put on an Atlanta Braves game and buy a box of cards to open and sort while watching. Rather than numerical order, I liked to sort my baseball cards into teams, alphabetized by players' last names. There was mass over production of cards in the late eighties and early nineties, with several companies competing with Topps, the OG card manufacturer. I bought cards by Upper Deck, Fleer, Donruss and more along with a monthly magazine that gave values to each card. Most of them were worthless, then, and now. I gave up on baseball when it turned out that the success of players I admired, like Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa and Roger Clemens, was due as much to their ingestion of performance enhancing drugs as it was to their talent. I sold a collection of some 20K cards for $100 and never looked back.</p>\n<p>When Napster came along and allowed computer nerds with broadband connections to download music as fast as we could type in bands to search for, I went nuts. I assembled the Rolling Stone Magazine collection of the top 500 rock albums of all time. Very few of the songs were tagged correctly, so I used various software titles and the website, <a href='https://allmusic.com'>Allmusic.com</a> to verify track names and track numbers and the genre and all the miscellaneous information like release dates on all the music I downloaded. I spent many hours sitting at a desktop Mac editing MP3 tags while listening to music. I loved it, and today I am grateful to my past self for having done such an outstanding job.</p>\n<p>These days, I am fanatical about keeping two types of data organized: my thousands of Obsidian notes and my photographs. Both of these lend themselves to being sorted in various ways digitally. I use both tags and folders because why not? During the upcoming holiday break, i will spend many hours happily looking at photos and reading notes and clipped articles and deciding where to file them. It sparks joy. It soothes me. Not only that, but it's what I like to do more than just about anything else.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

Created\nin 2004, it uses simple punctuation and characters to denote headers,\nlinks, emphasis, code blocks, lists and other styles. Markdown is often\nused for writing README files, documentation, or content for websites.\nThe language was designed for easy reading and writing. One issue with\nMarkdown is that it must be rendered before it looks ready for mass\nconsumption, including printing. Another issue is converting text into\nother formats, like .docx and .rtf.</p>\n\n<p>There are plenty of tools for those who use Markdown. For creating\ndocuments, I often use <a\nhref=\"https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/things-you-can-do-with-obsidian\">Obsidian</a>\nor <a\nhref=\"https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/markedit-a-pure-markdown-editor-for-free\">MarkEdit</a>,\nboth of which are free. Obsidian is a hugely powerful app that has over\n2000 plugins and can be overly complicated for some. It&#39;s also an\nelectron app that some people avoid for that reason.</p>\n\n<h2>Marked 2</h2>\n\n<p>My recommendation to render and print Markdown files is <a\nhref=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/marked-2-markdown-preview/id890031187?mt=12\">Marked\n2</a> by the great Mac developer, blogger and podcaster, Brett Terpstra.\nMarked 2 works with many different flavors of Markdown and is really\ngreat for developers writing GitHub documentation because it is capable\nof handling fenced code blocks, line break preservation and automatic\nhyperlinking. You can even get a spelling and grammar checker through\nIAP for Marked 2. It works with Obsidian, Scrivener, Ulysses, MarsEdit,\nHighland 2, iThoughtsX, MindNode, and other third-party apps. Aside from\nrendering and printing, Marked 2 also has impressive exporting features\nnatively, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>PDF (continuous or paginated)</li>\n<li>RTF</li>\n<li>RTFD</li>\n<li>DOC</li>\n<li>DOCX</li>\n<li>ODT</li>\n<li>OPML</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Marked 2 is not an editor. It only renders files.</p>\n\n<h2>Texts</h2>\n\n<p>If you want a WYSIWYG editor for Markdown with considerable exporting\nfeatures, you can use <a href=\"http://www.texts.io/features/\">Texts, a\nfree app.</a> Texts has great table support. What makes Texts special is\nits ability to import (and convert to Markdown) DOCX, OPML, HTML and\nLaTeX. It supports the same export formats as Marked and also adds</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>HTML</li>\n<li>HTML Presentations</li>\n<li>EPUB2</li>\n<li>EPUB3</li>\n<li>XeLaTex</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You can also print from Texts.</p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Two Apps To Use if You Work in Markdown' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

Living with a bipolar disorder diagnosis for nearly 40 years has given me the insight into my own thought patterns, feelings and behavior to recognize what's going on with myself and to take action. It starts with vague, uneasy, paranoid feelings. \"Why is everyone mad at me?\" (They actually aren't. It just feels that way) Then I feel a deep sadness and isolation for no apparent reason. Everything, and I mean absolutely everything, becomes difficult. I dread having to speak to anyone. For many years, up to the end of 2008, I medicated these feelings with the help of distilleries and breweries and the occasional pot dealer, but I put that behind me finally and for the past 16 years, I've dealt with the black dog on my own.</p>\n<p>I'm from the pre-Prozac generation, who had to endure old-fashioned tricyclic anti-depressants with all their many side effects back in the 80s. Modern psychotropic meds have come a long way. I've taken a whole catalog of them over the years and these days I have what my doc calls a poly-pharmacy that has few side effects, isn't addictive and is readily available from just about any druggist. Despite meds though, I still have weird mood swings and feelings that are a product of haywire brain chemistry rather than the events going on around me. The reality is that I have a low stress life, no financial pressure to speak of, no real enemies or resentments, an easy job and a good home life. That's why it is so maddening to feel so low. There is nothing to fix.</p>\n<p>Experience tells me that this too shall pass, as long as it isn't the start of a downward spiral, and this doesn't feel like that. I still have an interest in plenty of meaningful things. I'm still functional enough. My current mood is conveniently happening right before a long scheduled break from work. It's a time when I will have almost no responsibilities. I'll be able to get plenty of rest. The only person I'll have to deal with will be the one I love the most. All of that is good.</p>\n<p>I'm sorry that I don't have anything that interesting to share today. I'm struggling, but I will be OK.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

The people of this country put up with half our tax dollars going to military related spending or to service debt on previous military spending. It's framed as “defense” spending as if we are continually under so much of a threat that we must spend as much on our military as the rest of the world put together. When we do go to war, as in Iraq and Afghanistan, we incur debts our grandchildren will still be paying off for little noticeable safety or increase in quality of life.</p>\n<p>We also put up with squadrons of militarized police who enjoy near immunity for taking civilian lives, particularly minority lives. All they have to do is claim to have feared for their life over the toy your child was holding, and they can and do escape justice. We build prisons with money that could be used for schools. Politicians from both parties but these days primarily Republicans tell blatant lies about the crime rates to get elected and then rob social services to hire more cops and put more people in prison.</p>\n<p>Americans buy environmentally unfriendly SUVs because they think them to be safer than cars that get better gas mileage. The home alarm industry is thriving as people pour money into unreliable and easily defeated systems to keep out the bad guys. We throw out perfectly edible food because of arbitrary and misunderstood dates stamped on the can. Large sections of the population are now resisting vaccines because they are afraid of some unspecified and unproven boogeyman.</p>\n<p>The more afraid the ruling class can convince us to be, the more they can make themselves look goof by promising to protect us. The more money they can steer towards their cronies in the defense industries, the more they can consolidate power through quid pro quo donations and kickbacks. Where does it end?</p>\n<p>It permeates into everyday life. Most American workers, especially in non-unionized workplaces live fearing arbitrary layoffs or discipline without due process. Productivity and forward progress is often stymied by workers who fear making a decision for fear of “getting in trouble.” There are entire workplace cultures built around \"cover your ass” practices that add nothing to the mission or the bottom line.</p>\n<p>Conservatives tell those who are the most privileged in society, white, Christian affluent citizens that their way of life is threatened by, you guessed it, non-white, non-Christian, non-affluent people. They demonize the immigrants who pick our food, build our homes and work in our factories with lies about their criminality and cost to society.</p>\n<p>I'm so sick of it. I've felt real fear, the kind you feel when you think someone is going to do great violence to you. It's a horrible, shameful, emasculating feeling that can, in just a few moments, alter your entire life. I never want to feel that again and ever since I had that experience, I've tried not to let fear of any kind be a feeling associated with my self-identity. I'm not afraid of immigrants or terrorists or gangs of crazed criminals or of getting fired because I didn't get the boss's permission to do X. I reject all of that. I choose to live in a world where I believe we can solve the problems we face with something besides cruise missiles, more cops and restricting the rights of whole classes of people.</p>\n<p>The ruling class better be careful. The scare tactics are working today, but in all of human history, no society has remained as subjugated as ours is becoming without the pitchforks coming out in the end. We are developing a societal case of PTSD based on the lies we have been fed and the results will not be pretty.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

Whatever tools you choose have to balance with usability because we all have work we have to get done.</p>\n<h2 id=next-dns>Next DNS</h2><p>The classic uBlock Origin ad blocker was deprecated by Google Chrome  in favor of a less powerful Light version. With the ever-increasing need for security ,Mac users have the option of downloading the <a href='https://apps.apple.com/app/nextdns/id1464122853'>NextDNS configuration app</a> from the Mac App Store and setting up a free account with the enhanced DNS server. If you aren't into acronyms, DNS stands for dynamic name service and it is what translates IP addresses into the URLs we use to name websites. You can use a special DNS service to block malware, ads, trackers and other unwanted traffic from ever reaching your computer by using one.</p>\n<p><a href='https://nextdns.io/'>NextDNS</a> is free for up to 300,000 queries a month, and you can use the same account on multiple computers, mobile devices and your router. It works on Macs and PCs, iPhones and Android devices - on anything that allows you to enter your network settings. If you have a large household and require a paid account, it is just $1.99 a month.</p>\n<p>Technically speaking, you don't even have to use the app. NextDNS can automatically generate a profile for you to use on your Mac and mobile devices and if you have the right kind of router, you can set it up without having to make ANY modifications to your computer.</p>\n<p><strong>NextDNS Features</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ads and Trackers - currently blocking 119,372 addresses</li>\n<li>Block domains known to distribute malware, launch phishing attacks and host command-and-control servers using a blend of the most reputable threat intelligence feeds -- all updated in real-time.</li>\n<li>Block malware and phishing domains using Google Safe Browsing -- a technology that examines billions of URLs per day looking for unsafe websites.

I use Vivaldi's built-in ad and tracker blocking along with uBlock Origin Lite multi-spectrum content blocker plugin to block ads, trackers, malicious URLs and more. Among the most security conscious Mac users who don't need to use a Chromium browser, it is generally accepted that <a href='https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/'>Firefox with uBlock Origin</a> provides the best experience.</p>\n<p>These products all work together to provide as safe an environment as I feel I can craft on my Mac.

The power\nusers of the world explained it to me as the universal quick capture app\nfor my phone. I was advised to always enter text into Drafts no matter\nwhere I eventually wanted it to end up. I dutifully put it into my dock,\nand it&#39;s been there ever since. In this post, I&#39;m going to go over eight\ndifferent ways I use Drafts. It&#39;s important to note that it pays off to\ngive it a prominent place in your iOS sharing setting for ease of use.\nOn macOS it should show up in the share settings by default.</p>\n\n<p><br />1. Copy to Obsidian Inbox</p>\n\n<p>I am all in on <a href=\"https://obsidian.md/\">Obsidian</a> the massively\npopular note&#39;s app with a robust 1600+ plugin architecture. It does a\nlot of things amazing well but mobile quick capture is not one of them.\nTo solve that, I use <a\nhref=\"https://directory.getdrafts.com/a/1qB)\">this Drafts action</a>\nwhich saves the text to the default save location in my vault and uses\nthe first line of the text as the note title/file name. I use a couple\nof other Drafts to Obsidian actions including <a\nhref=\"https://directory.getdrafts.com/a/2EO\">Add to Obsidian Daily\nNote</a> and <a href=\"https://directory.getdrafts.com/a/2Fc\">Add to\nDaily Note Plus</a> which add text to my daily note in different ways\nusing a time stamp and a geolocation.</p>\n\n<p><br />2. The Things 3, Fantastical, Day One Combo</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://directory.getdrafts.com/g/1Sd\">Quick Journaling\nAction Group</a> lets me keep one running note that I can process at\nday&#39;s end to send the individual lines as entries into <a\nhref=\"https://flexibits.com/fantastical\">Fantastical,</a> <a\nhref=\"https://culturedcode.com/things/\">Things 3</a> and <a\nhref=\"https://dayoneapp.com/\">Day One</a>.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Lines starting with \"-\" are collected and sent to Day One as a journal entry</li>\n<li>Lines starting with \"⁎\" are sent to Things inbox</li>\n<li>Lines starting with \"@\" are sent to Fantastical</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><br />3. Things Parser</p>\n\n<p>Using <a href=\"https://guide.taskpaper.com/getting-started/\">Task Paper\nsyntax</a> I can create a note in Drafts complete with due dates, areas,\nprojects and tags that get correctly imported into the Things 3 task\nmanager using the <a href=\"https://directory.getdrafts.com/a/1DV\">Things\nParser.</a> I use this with a Drafts template to create daily and weekly\nchecklists for reoccurring tasks. I also use the action group, Things\nfor Things which includes actions for:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Inbox</li>\n<li>Today</li>\n<li>This Evening</li>\n<li>Tomorrow</li>\n<li>Pick date</li>\n<li>Work</li>\n<li>House</li>\n<li>Personal</li>\n<li>Pick a Project</li>\n<li>Make a Project</li>\n<li>Selection to things</li>\n<li>Bunch of todos</li>\n<li>Process notes from</li>\n<li>Prompt for new task</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><br />4. Mail to Evernote</p>\n\n<p>Yep, I still use Evernote for some tasks. Old habits die hard. Evernote\neliminated AppleScript a while back and their API has become more and\nmore problematic , but one feature they still support and that works\nequally well on iOS and macOS is the <a\nhref=\"https://directory.getdrafts.com/a/2Jr\">mail to Evernote</a>\nfeature and this Drafts action accomplishes that without you ever having\nto use your mail client.</p>\n\n<p><br />5. Micro.blogging</p>\n\n<p>This blog is hosted by <a href=\"http://micro.blog/\">Micro.blog</a> and I\ncan create entries in Drafts and have them posted online by running an\naction. I use the action <a\nhref=\"https://directory.getdrafts.com/a/1Hg\">Post to Micro.blog with\nTitle</a> by the great blogger <a href=\"https://birchtree.me/\">Matt\nBirchler.<br /></a><br /></p>\n\n<p><br />6. <a href=\"http://omg.lol/\">OMG.LOL</a> Status</p>\n\n<p>I am a big fan of the almost indescribable web community at <a\nhref=\"https://amerpie.lol/2024/05/09/https.omg.lol\">OMG.LOL</a>. One of\nthe fun features there is a status board you can share with other\nmembers, post on your website and cross-post to Mastodon (where all the\ncool kids hang out). The <a\nhref=\"https://directory.getdrafts.com/a/2DT\">OMG.LOL Status action</a>\ndoes it all.</p>\n\n<p><br />7. Run Shortcut to Save to Thoughts Inspiration Manager</p>\n\n<p>One of my favorite things to do online is to collect quotes from various\nsources, I save my quotes in an app called <a\nhref=\"https://thoughts-app.com/\">Thoughts Inspiration Manager</a>. I\ndon&#39;t have a Drafts action to write directly to Thoughts but it doesn&#39;t\nmatter because I have a Shortcut that does. I just need to run the\nDrafts shortcut action <a\nhref=\"https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/automation/shortcuts\">explained in\nthe user guide.<br /></a><br /></p>\n\n<p><br />8. Personal Assistant</p>\n\n<p>Drafts can serve as an interface with OpenAI by using the <a\nhref=\"https://directory.getdrafts.com/a/2Jl\">Personal Assistant\naction.</a> (using your own API key) It&#39;s a helpful action to run when\nyou know you are going to use the AI generated text in another app. This\naction allows the user to get an AI-assisted response to a prompt:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The user is prompted to enter input, which can be pasted from the clipboard or manually entered.</li>\n<li>The input is then sent to the OpenAI API, and the response is inserted into the current draft 3 lines after the cursor.</li>\n<li>If there is no selected text in the draft, the user is asked if they would like to use text from the clipboard. If the prompt is canceled or the input is empty, the action cancels.</li>\n<li>If there is no response from the API, the output is set to \"No reply received.\"</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Drafts Pro 50% Off for New Users' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

In case you didn't know, pools are a giant PIA. One day, the pump just quit working. It wasn't all that old, but it seems that few things last very long anymore. In situations like that, my inclination is to make phone calls, to a plumber, a pool guy or a general handyman, until I can find someone to come resolve my problem. My wife's mind does not work like mine. She inspected the pump, got the specs, ordered a replacement overnight from Amazon, and the next day, she installed it be herself. She is a CPA by trade, and I don't think they teach that in accounting school. </p>\n<p>I was a lot handier early in life when I could not afford to hire people to fix things. I let those skills atrophy when I finally made enough money to pay someone else to relieve me of the burden of handyman duty. Computers are the only thing I enjoy working on. Wonder Woman uses some of her vices as tools to get things done. She is not known for her patience. One of the reasons she is so quick to repair plumbing and electrical issues is that when she takes care of those things, it eliminates having to wait on someone else's schedule. Although she is generally friendly and personable, she is a true introvert. Having a stranger in the house who might talk to her or ask her questions is one of her least favorite things on the planet. In the entire time we have been married, she has never answered the door when I was home. That is my job and I don't really mind.</p>\n<p>There's just the two of us at home, and the division of labor falls more heavily on her than it does on me. I am responsible for cooking dinner. Cooking is one of my talents and enjoyable when I have the time. . Since I went back to work, however, we have been eating things that can be prepared quickly. We used a meal service, one of those that mails you food, for a while, but it eventually became repetitive. I've promised to go back to cooking from scratch when I retire for good. I am also responsible for the yard, which at one time meant that I mowed it once a week, but now means that I am the one to write the check to Juan, our yard guy. He needs to get Venmo!</p>\n<p>I help fold clothes. Sometimes. I unload the dishwasher. Occasionally. We have a housekeeping service in a couple of times a month and I sort of help straighten up before they come. Mostly, I am spoiled. Wonder Woman moves fast and in the span of time it takes me to figure out how to do most things, she has already done them. It isn't weaponized incompetence on my part. She is just faster at doing everything than anyone else around her. It doesn't matter what the task is or who the other parties are. On group bike rides full of alpha males from all walks of life, when someone has a flat tire, she's the one who usually changes everyone's tube for them. She is just good like that.</p>\n<p>She doesn't even like me to fix her IT problems unless it is something truly devilish. I've only been doing computer support for 30 years. She'd rather get mad and scare her laptop into acting right than she would hand it to me so I can figure out what's going on. She's classic Type A over achiever material. I can't tell you how many times I've been chastised for the sin of walking all the way across a parking lot without having the keys out and ready to use when I get to the car.

Access is using Apple’s industry-leading iCloud Encryption\nto protect your information. No data is ever sent to any server other\nthan iCloud.

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/58-1.webp\" alt=\"Love_sign\" /></p>\n<p>One of the primary criticisms of social media is that people present an idealized representation of their lives. We get to see the beautiful photos of the beach they sat on while on vacation but we don't see the mildew in the resort bathroom or the credit card bill they incurred for the privilege. People are more than willing to share the pictures of the prefect steaks on their grills without also showing the seven Lean Cuisines they ate in the past three days. We don't see pictures of how our friends look after just waking up or read a lot about the opportunities they didn't get at work and are therefore not pleased to announce on LinkedIn.</p>\n<p>I am as guilty as anyone in some ways. I would rather not be a Debbie Downer or mark myself as a whiner by complaining online. Who really wants to hear that? As a photographer, I'm going to take 1000 pictures to show you 10. That's the way it works. Most of us are not pretending to be someone we are not. We are just putting our best foot forward, sharing things we are proud of or that we are celebrating. I know my friends well enough to know they don't have perfect lives, regardless of what it looks like on Facebook, Bluesky or Mastodon. Hopefully, I don't have too may friends still using Twitter.</p>\n<p>As a blogger whose style is autobiographical, I strive to be honest. I don't mind revealing a few warts. The people who know me, know I have them, and what do I really have to lose if the people who don't know me find out my various imperfections? I would hope they would get it on some level. By not pretending to be perfect, I think it makes the rest of what I write more relatable.</p>\n<p>I'd like to be able to present myself as having been born with great political sensibilities, but that isn't the case. Teenage me had no understanding of politics. The vote I cast in my first presidential election isn't something I talk about much. There was no passion and not much thought behind it. I voted because the country gave me the privilege because I'd managed to live for 18 years. I even skipped a couple of elections. I felt vaguely guilty about it, but it just seemed like a hassle. In 1988, I could not have told you much of anything about George H. W. Bush or Michael Dukakis.</p>\n<p>When it comes to tech, the field where I made my career, there are many, many areas where I have little aptitude and less interest. I was happy as a  K-12  IT specialist for two decades. In tech, like other fields, if you want to advance, you have to leave the keyboard and mouse skills behind and take up the soft skills of managing people to advance. Call me a slacker, but I was not interested. I'm finishing out my working years in higher ed, doing end user support with no interest in becoming a network engineer or a system administrator. I'm not having a contest with anyone in real life or on the Internet to be the smartest computer guy in the room. I just want my paycheck and room to do the job I have.</p>\n<p>In my personal life, what you see is mostly what you get. I do, in fact, adore my wife. She treats me great and while I won't tell you her every complaint, I can assure you that they are all warranted and none of them are selfish. I have some family relationships that are more difficult than others, but again, the truth is that I love being a Dad and a grandfather more than just about anything apart from being Wonder Woman's husband.</p>\n<p>I am just another regular guy with one list of things I am proud of and another list I don't want to talk about. I'm pretty happy in general, although I'm worried about the world, both right now and in the future. I do my best to be genuine, even if my story telling instinct can be a bone of contention between me and my personal fact-checker (Wonder Woman). <BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

Even though we are spread across the state, we gathered for the experience for which we’d purchased tickets months in advance.</p>\n<p>Prior to boarding the train, we stood with other families in the chill air. Most people, including most of us were wearing pajamas. Local actors performed a few skits. We sang Christmas carols and judged three kiddos in a contest to see who could say “HoHoHo” the best.</p>\n<p>Once on the train, we had our golden tickets punched. We were greeted by young actors playing characters from the book. Then we were served hot chocolate and cookies while we listened to an actor read the book to us. We stopped briefly at the North Pole where we disembarked to visit with the elves.</p>\n<p>When we reboarded, each seat had a gift in it. Then Santa made his way down the length of the train and gave every passenger a silver bell. Before we knew it, we were back at the station.</p>\n<p>The kids, ranging in age from a couple of kindergarteners up through a high school freshman, were all well behaved I was happy to make this memory with them. I’m up past my bedtime, but it was worth it.  <BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

It provides an app by app breakdown of all open files and sockets\nin use by all running processes on your system. This makes it easy to\ninspect which apps are using which files and sockets. In activity\nmonitor, you get information on processes, but not on what app they\nbelong to or where they are located on disk. Every so often, when you\nare troubleshooting an obscure problem, you need that information. I\nrecently had to track down what app was causing my Mac to slow to a\ncrawl every time I encountered an open/save dialog box. Sloth was\nhelpful during that process.</p>\n\n<p>You may end up surprised at some processes running on your box. Despite\neverything I have tried, the inescapable Adobe virus insists on running\nsome process whenever my computer is on, despite having all their apps\nset to not run at login.</p>\n\n<h2>Features</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>View all open files, directories, IP sockets, devices, Unix domain sockets and pipes</li>\n<li>Filter by name, access mode, volume, type, location, or using regular expressions</li>\n<li>Sort by name, process ID, user ID, process type, bundle identifier, etc.</li>\n<li>View IP socket status, protocol and version</li>\n<li>View sockets and pipes established between processes</li>\n<li>Inspection window with detailed macOS and Unix file/socket/process info</li>\n<li>Powerful contextual menu for file operations</li>\n<li>In-app authentication to run with root privileges</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Sloth is <a href=\"https://sveinbjorn.org/sloth/\">available on GitHub</a>\nand can be downloaded via Homebrew. </p>\n\n<pre>$ brew install --cask sloth</pre>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Sloth - Activity Monitor on Steroids' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

I am exhausted by the virtue-signaling pretend progressives preaching on the Internet  about how \"murder is murder\" and acting all judgy at those of us who aren't mourning the death of a vulture capitalist who let sick people die to enhance shareholder value for United Healthcare. Just shut up. There are no vigilante armies being formed to come to your job and shoot your boss. Maybe there will be a copycat or too, but we are not in the midst of a revolution. Yet.</p>\n<p>In the 60s, the folk singer, Phil Ochs recorded a scathing song called <em><a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=lyrics%20to%20love%20me%20i%27m%20a%20liberal%20by%20phil%20ochs'>Love Me,  I'm a Liberal.</a></em> Its lyrics are dated now with references to people long forgotten, but its spirit lives on. It jabs at people who want change, as long as it isn't messy. I wonder what exactly the pearl clutching crowd thinks it's going to take to get the kind of change we need to our healthcare system. Do they think that all those billionaires Trump is appointing to government positions are going to suddenly give a shit about sick middle-class and poor people? I suspect most of them have never experienced anything more than a slight inconvenience when it comes to the for-profit healthcare system.</p>\n<p>Here's my story. I am a big guy, I've weighed over 200 pounds (ca. 91 kg) almost all of my adult life, sometimes a lot more. In my 40s, I decided to become an endurance athlete. I took up ultra-distance cycling and then long distance hiking. Even in more relaxed times I chose walking as my primary form of exercise. I developed osteoarthritis in both knees. Eventually, all the cartilage that cushions the collision between my femurs and the bones of my lower legs was gone. I had extremely painful bone on bone contact that ached constantly, making it hard to sleep or to be mobile. Every attempt at getting treatment for years was met with delays, denials and deception. The shots that provided the most relief cost a $1000 a pop. I was supposed to get them every six-months but the insurance company always dragged their feet getting things approved, and I usually had to wait eight or nine months. It was up to me to make numerous phone calls to every part of the system - the doctor, the pharmacy, and the insurance company.</p>\n<p>The constant scramble to get treatment disrupted my job. It eventually left me  severely depressed. I went from a fit man who hiked the entire 2,189-mile Appalachian Trail in 2013, to someone who could not walk a mile by 2020. That year I had both of my knees surgically replaced. at age 55 and retired early. I will probably never regain the fitness I previously enjoyed - all because an insurance company made life purposefully difficult in the hope that I would just give up and stop seeking treatment. All of that sucks for me, but it pales in comparison to the countless people who have lost their life savings and their lives after being denied needed medical care.</p>\n<p>I do not care how messy it gets to fix our broken system. I don't have sympathy for the dead CEO because all my sympathy is used up on the suffering people of this country whose problems he and his fellow travelers cause. I am reaching the \"any means necessary\" phase of my life. When a people are held down by a ruthless ruling class, they eventually snap. Did you see what just happened in Syria? After paying a horrible, horrible price, they got rid of an autocratic despot. If you think the same thing couldn't happen in this country where there are more guns than people - well LOL.,<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

You have the option to create an account if you want to sync\nyour codes between devices, or you can skip that if you just want to use\nit on a single device.</p>\n\n<p>The desktop version of Ente Auth has some nice features I haven&#39;t seen\nelsewhere. Not only does it show you the current 2FA code for your app,\nit also shows you the next code in the sequence. This eliminates the\naggravating wait for the codes to change when there are only a few\nseconds left in the lifetime of the current code. You can also configure\nthe desktop app to open directly to the search field, so you can\nimmediately begin searching for the code you need.</p>\n\n<p>It can be a hassle to set up a new authenticator, since you have to\nmanually add sites. Most do not allow you to use more than one app to do\n2FA. Still, it is a one-time chore and worth it for the convenience of\nhaving a secure desktop app with end-to-end encryption.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to Justin Pot for his article on <a\nhref=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/two-factor-alternative-to-authy\">Lifehacker</a>\nabout Ente Auth.</p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Ente Auth - The Free Authy Replacement for Your Mac and iPhone' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/29-1.webp\" alt=\"2024-12-12 at 19\" /></p>\n<p>As long as I can remember, i've enjoyed visiting the past in my imagination, something i can do just as easily with a Wikipedia article as I can while watching Lonesome Dove for the tenth time. Growing up, I loved my grandparent's' stories of living on rural farms before and during the Great Depression. Even my parents (who are only 17 years older than me) have fascinating tales of seeing Elvis and the Beatles on TV. Since I live on the East coast, my part of the US has recorded history that stretches back to pre-colonial times, and Native American history that goes back much further. General Sherman's troops marched down the road that lies at the end of my street on their way to burn a Confederate Arsenal whose ruins can still be seen. The US Constitution was ratified by my home state about three miles from where I live.</p>\n<p>During the American bicentennial in 1976, I was in the fifth grade, and along with kids all over the country, spent a full year learning colonial history to a degree that has probably never been duplicated. Numerous battles between American revolutionary forces and British troops took place with driving distance at Guilford Courthouse, King's Mountain and Moore's Creek Bridge. I've been to them all.</p>\n<p>Unlike many southerners, I am totally fine with the way the Civil War ended up. I'm no believer in the lost cause and I don't romanticize the reasons for the war in any way. It was fought to end slavery in the south, and it ended just as it should have. As a former infantry soldier, I can hardly imagine the discipline and courage of those who fought in that era. I've visited Gettysburg, and stood on the ridge where Union forces held their ground as thousands of Confederate infantry marched in formation across  from where their lines formed in front of a religious seminary a mile away.  It took my breath away and brought tears to my eyes.</p>\n<p>I don't know if those who forget history are really condemned to repeat it. Having always been interested in the past, I am amazed when I encounter intelligent people who can't tell you the decade in which the majority of World War Two was fought. Some can't tell you who was president of the US when they were born. I can't even wrap my mind around being able to name who a pop star is married to while not knowing basic historical facts. I interpret almost everything that is currently happening in the world through a historical lens. I can't imagine functioning without being able to do that. That’s just me.</p>\n<p>Obviously, I place a lot of value in curiosity and imagination. I'd much rather watch a historical drama than a superhero movie. It's not that I think the MCU is a bad thing for bad people, it just doesn't spark anything in me. I can't put myself in the character's shoes the way I can when a film has a historical reference, whatever it is.</p>\n<p>History is written by the victors, it is said. What we know from books, including textbooks, is what the people who wrote those books want us to know. That is why my life changed forever when I read A People's History of the United States by Howard Zinn, and Lies My Teacher Told Me by James Loewen at the age of 36. Suddenly, I realized that entire, important and meaningful pieces of American history had been purposefully obscured to keep from realizing their own power as union members, freed slaves, suffragettes and more. The first time I read a book about the formation of Israel from the perspective apart from the Jewish one, I was in disbelief. How come no one ever told me any of this stuff? I had a similar feeling when I learned that 85% of the Nazis who died in battle were killed by the Soviet Army. America did not win the war and save the world from fascism.. It played a part, sure, but a secondary part. More world view and my outlook on history have never been the same, and I am dedicated to learning more than what the power structure wants us to know.\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

It's the type of word your grandmother would use, or maybe  someone else not quite as cool as they ought to be. Personally, I think that is hogwash. I think delight is an outstanding word. You know what is better than the word? The feeling of being delighted, that's what. Let's define it.</p>\n<p><strong>Delight - A feeling of great pleasure and satisfaction:</strong> <em>the little girls squealed with delight</em></p>\n<p>I don't know about you, but I'm ready to have something to squeal at. Bring it on!</p>\n<p>Today, what delighted me was the release of an update to my computer that featured an app that can take pictures of my grandkids and turn them into cute-ass princesses and cowboys. I've been waiting to use this app ever since it was announced. I updated my Mac immediately and started making pictures and sending them to my kids, my wife, and my grandkids. I was delighted. I had great feelings of pleasure and satisfaction. A lot of grumpy, stick up their ass types do not like this new feature because it uses AI, but there have been similar apps around for ages. It's a neat parlor trick. It makes kids and old men happy and if you don't like it, I feel sorry for you.</p>\n<p>I am also delighted to get off work every single day. I value my time in the evenings to be with Wonder Woman, to eat whatever I want for supper and to engage in my hobby - writing this blog. At work, I have to do stuff I don't always like doing, such as installing Windows or helping ungrateful people who think it is my fault they forgot their damn password again. I'm at the point where after many, many years of suiting up and showing up, doing eight hours for the man no longer sparks joy. Ever.</p>\n<p>Climbing into bed at the end of the day is another wonderful event. I have a good bed with an expensive mattress. My pillows won a tournament for the privilege of serving me. I have a great iPad I bought just to read every night for 15–30 minutes before I go to sleep. Through the miracle of modern technology, I have a silent machine that helps me breath all night long without interruption, something I am unable to do by myself. It allows me to sleep so soundly that I do not have to get up and pee every 90 minutes like I used to. That is a delight, I don't care what anyone says. I am able to climb out of bed in the morning to make my way to the coffee pot feeling rested and ready to start the day.</p>\n<p>I am on the lookout for opportunities to be delighted throughout the day. My phone is a delight machine if I have ever seen one. It is capable of producing music that not only makes me happy today, it's been making me happy since childhood. Every time I hear Paul McCartney sing “Hear Comes the Sun” or Bruce Springsteen and the boys play “Cadillac Ranch”, I am delighted. When I take a quick glance at a text message from my profane daughter complaining about something spectacularly fucked-up, I am delighted that she is so good at expressing herself and that she chooses to share it with me. I will not lie, I have notifications turned on and that sweet stream of dopamine that I get when one of my social media posts resonates with people — my friend, it brings me great pleasure and satisfaction.</p>\n<p>Wherever you are right now, whatever you are doing, start thinking about finding something delightful before you go to bed. Call your Mom, buy a Snickers bar, read an article from The Onion, howl at the moon. Do something to find some pleasure in this world that seems designed to drag us down and keep us at the bottom. Don't let the bastards win.\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

I'm just a reasonably well-read layman who knows that for over a century, white people have had some wacky ideas about race and music. I's been going on since the Jazz age. If you play hip-hop around most white boomers, they freak out on a pretty regular basis. If it's not the language, it's some other criticism, usually centered around rap, and it's fellow travelers not being “regular” or “American” music. These are the same boomers who all listened to Motown when they were in school and came of age watching Elvis Presley get away with movements only a white boy could get away with.</p>\n<p>Today there are regular controversies over institutionalized racism in country music, with the CMA ignoring the immense popularity of Beyonce's country album, Cowboy Carter. Then there was the ridiculous and unnecessary inclusion of Billy Ray Cyrus  on Old Town Road by Lil Nas X, who being both black and gay was as big an affront to Nashville as there could be for someone who made a damn fine song.</p>\n<p>Fortunately for me, I was born 52 day into 1965. Thus, I am firmly in Generation X and I feel no irony in my appreciation of Public Enemy and NWA from the heady days of the late nineties. In fact, I am just the right age to have enjoyed Rapper's Delight by the Sugar Hill Gang when it was being played on the radio.</p>\n<p>If you are a hip hop loving boomer, don't be offended. I am happy there are outliers like you.</p>\n<p><a href='https://oberlinreview.org/26012/opinions/debates-around-rap-musics-validity-rooted-in-racism/'>Debates Around Rap Music’s Validity Rooted in Racism – The Oberlin Review</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcCK99wHrk0'>The Sugarhill Gang - Rapper's Delight (Official Video) - YouTube</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/feb/27/black-artistry-is-woven-into-the-fabric-of-country-music-it-belongs-to-everyone-beyonce-texas-hold-em-rhiannon-giddens'>Black artistry is woven into the fabric of country music.

Sometimes, though, we\nencounter text in other languages in books and documents or when we\naren&#39;t connected to the Internet. Then it&#39;s not possible to use a\nbrowser. Also, even though Google Translate is the de facto standard,\nthere are other translation engines that some feel are better. Here are\na few options.</p>\n\n<h2>Translator - Offline Translate</h2>\n\n<p>If you want a tool for Mac that works when you don&#39;t have a connection,\nthis is what you need. It&#39;s only 3.99 in the <a\nhref=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/%C3%BCbersetzer-offline-%C3%BCbersetzen/id6686403979?mt=12\">Mac\nApp Store</a>. It is a one-time purchase, not a subscription and\ninstalls as a menu bar app. One drawback is a limited number of\nsupported languages when compared to online versions. It supports:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Arabic</li>\n<li>Chinese (Mandarin - China Mainland)</li>\n<li>Chinese (Mandarin - Taiwan)</li>\n<li>Dutch</li>\n<li>English (US)</li>\n<li>English (UK)</li>\n<li>French (France)</li>\n<li>German (Germany)</li>\n<li>Indonesian</li>\n<li>Italian (Italy)</li>\n<li>Japanese</li>\n<li>Korean</li>\n<li>Polish</li>\n<li>Portuguese (Brazil)</li>\n<li>Russian</li>\n<li>Spanish (Spain)</li>\n<li>Thai</li>\n<li>Turkish</li>\n<li>Ukrainian</li>\n<li>Vietnamese</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Google Translate Web View</h2>\n\n<p>This free app is a web view wrapper for Google Translate that operates\nfrom your menu bar and can be summoned with a hotkey. It is <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/dbilgili/GoogleTranslate\">available on\nGithub</a>. It has a limit of 5,000 characters at a time. It does have\nbuilt in OCR for images, so you can upload those to have them\ninterpreted. Google Translate offers automatic language detection if you\nare unsure what you are dealing with. This is an unsigned app, so you\nwill have to give permission to bypass Gatekeeper. Google supports\ntranslation into 108 languages.</p>\n\n<h2>DeepL</h2>\n\n<p>Some feel the private company, DeepL, <a\nhref=\"https://www.deepl.com/en/products/translator\">offers a product\n</a>with superior translation abilities when compared to Google. It&#39;s\npaid services offer the ability to upload and translate large documents,\nincluding PDFs. The free service provides you with three documents a\nmonth of up to 5MB and, like the other apps in this review, provides\nreal-time translation from the menu bar. DeepL supports the following\nlanguages:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic\">Arabic</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgarian_language\">Bulgarian</a></li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language\">Chinese</a> (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters\">simplified</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters\">traditional</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_language\">Czech</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_language\">Danish</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_language\">Dutch</a></li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language\">English</a> (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English\">American</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English\">British</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonian_language\">Estonian</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_language\">Finnish</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language\">French</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language\">German</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language\">Greek</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_language\">Hungarian</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_language\">Indonesian</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language\">Italian</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language\">Japanese</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language\">Korean</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvian_language\">Latvian</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_language\">Lithuanian</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_language\">Norwegian</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_language\">Polish</a></li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_language\">Portuguese</a> (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_Portuguese\">Brazilian</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Portuguese\">European</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_language\">Romanian</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language\">Russian</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovak_language\">Slovak</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovene_language\">Slovenian</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language\">Spanish</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_language\">Swedish</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_language\">Turkish</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_language\">Ukrainian</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Mac Translation Apps - Offline, Google and DeepL' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/35-2.webp\" alt=\"Statue\" /></p>\n<p>I'm feeling a little scattered today. Yesterday was traumatic and today had some rebound from that. Luckily, I had a project to work on this afternoon that kept me from stewing in my own juices. It was nothing complicated, just upgrading some old laptops to provide for a student led research project in our athletics department. I had to swap out some parts and install Windows for the millionth time in my life (x4). I'm glad someone can make use of these devices. It makes me sad when we recycle usable equipment. I'm always contemplating building my own home lab, but it would be a time suck that wouldn't go over well with Wonder Woman.<br />\nHere are a few updates</p>\n<h2 id=tech>Tech</h2><p>Like plenty of other people, I am waiting for the updates from Apple to iOS and macOS with promised new AI features. The image playground looks like something I will play with for about 30 minutes and then never use again, but I want my 30 minutes. I've made use of the writing tools Apple included in the last update. I'm still waiting for them to be added to my writing app of choice, Obsidian so that I don't have to copy and paste text in other places to use the service, though.</p>\n<h2 id=travel>Travel</h2><p>Our December plans include a Christmas trip to two spots on the North Carolina coast where our parts of our family live. We'll also make our way down Interstate 40 to the Piedmont area of NC, where one of our daughters lives. The big trip will be a three-day getaway to Savannah, GA. Wonder Woman was initially going to run a marathon down there but decided to do the one in Miami scheduled for February instead. On this trip, we are just going to do typical tourist stuff, including a tour of the cemetery that was on the cover of the book <em>Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,</em> one of my all-time favorites. </p>\n<h2 id=work>Work</h2><p>My boss promised to speak to the supervisor of the crazy woman who caused me so much grief yesterday. He tried to talk me into being one of those people who lets everything roll off their back. His background is in medical IT, and he had many stories about abusive doctors. I just told him that we aren't in the high stakes world of saving lives. We are a staid liberal arts school in the South where people are supposed to be nice. I spent my late teens and twenties in the Infantry and working in a prison. I got a lifetime of abuse between those two places, and I don't have room in my psyche for anymore.</p>\n<h2 id=family>Family</h2><p>My dad let us all know that he's hired someone to help him and my stepmother. His health is declining with a recent stroke, auto accident and surgery, while he is also serving as the sole caregiver for his wife who has advanced Alzheimer's. Having someone in the house to do some of the chores and give him a break from the constant need to be on alert is going to make things better for both of them. I live closer to him than any of my siblings, but I still don't get over as much as I'd like.</p>\n<h2 id=indie-web>Indie Web</h2><p>Even though I missed a day of posting to one of my blogs a couple of weeks ago, I haven't been discouraged by having to start a new streak. I look forward to writing every day, to finding an app to review and deciding what links to share. I wrote a piece for the December Indie Web Carnival. Furthermore, I have been trying to be active on both Mastodon and Bluesky with some success. Mastodon still feels like home, but the larger Bluesky community has been good for getting more news on Apple tech and Obsidian resources.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

In case you are wondering, yes, that can be a serious impediment to personal and professional goals, so I've learned a few tricks over the years. None of them are really surprising, but they can and do make life easier when i use them.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Say yes to less stuff. I am a people pleaser by nature and take pride in being helpful, but that can get you put in the middle of the 20% of people in any group who do 80% of the work. That's cool if you enjoy the work, not so much if it is a burden.</li>\n<li>Knock out the hard stuff first. More often than not, the pain for procrastinators is in the dread of having to do things they don't want to do rather than in actually doing them.</li>\n<li>Have hard hobbies - whether it's riding a bike for 100 miles at a stretch, dead lifting and squatting 400 lbs. or hiking the Appalachian Trail, I've done enough hard things that I can't lie to myself when faced with lesser tasks.</li>\n<li>If you fear doing something, if that is the hard bit, having someone to talk it through with is a life saver. I'd rather relax my ego some and confess trepidation than pretend to be stoic when I'm scared.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href='https://hbr.org/2021/12/how-to-convince-yourself-to-do-hard-things'>How to Convince Yourself to Do Hard Things</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://www.lightkey.io/post/train-your-brain-for-hard-things'>10 Ways To Train Your Brain To Do Hard Things</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://www.johnmashni.com/blog/how-to-do-hard-things'>How to Do Hard Things — JOHN MASHNI</a>\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

It was a point and click workflow manager for those who\npreferred that type of workflow over apps like Alfred and Launchbar. The\ndeveloper of Dragthing was an Apple employee to worked on the original\nimplementation of the dock in Mac OS X. He created Dragthing as an\nalternate version of what the dock could have been. It was an immensely\npopular app among power users and won many awards in its 24 years on the\nmarket (1995-2019).</p>\n\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://naarakstudio.com/icollections/index.html\">iCollections</a>\nby developer Grzegorz Staszczyk provides an experience much like\nDragthing once did. It provides a a variety of desktop interfaces for\nvarious ways to view content and control your Mac. The interface is\nbased on what the app calls collections. These are windows or drawers\ncontaining any one of the following elements:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Disks (including external storage and mounted disk images)</li>\n<li>Access to dock items from the menu bar</li>\n<li>Folders (e.g., Downloads, Documents) - use tabs to see multiple folders in one window</li>\n<li>Drop shelf for temporary file storage</li>\n<li>Photo frame (with slide shows)</li>\n<li>Web view using iOS user agent for any website</li>\n<li>Open processes</li>\n<li>Open Windows</li>\n<li>Trash</li>\n<li>Calendar</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Every element has multiple customization options including color, size,\nposition and opacity. You can use custom icons, even for native Mac\napplications, something you cannot do in Finder. You can combine\nkeyboard shortcuts with point and click functions to summon collections\nwhen you need them. To use a folder as a launcher, just add application\naliases to it.</p>\n\n<p>iCollections can be downloaded from the developer&#39;s website to take\nadvantage of a free trial. It can also be downloaded from the Mac App\nStore. The cost is:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Monthly Subscription$2.99</li>\n<li>Annual Subscription$12.99</li>\n<li>Lifetime License$39.99</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=iCollections - A Desktop Centric Workflow Manager Similar to the Classic Dragthing' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/49-1.webp\" alt=\"On_the_ledge\" /></p>\n<p>If one of my friends came to me upset because they had been treated disrespectfully by someone at work, I'd ask them not to let themselves be defined by some random rude person. The world is full of assholes and unfortunately, we all encounter them from time to time. I'd let my friend talk it out and vent because that can help people begin to deescalate a bit. I'd help them come up with the best way to handle the situation. Was the asshole a peer, a supervisor, or a customer? Most of the time, the best advice will be to just go on living your life, doing your job and not to give the offender the satisfaction of knowing that they got to you. I would feel some compassion and gladly help them work through it because that's what friends are for.</p>\n<p>I don't do so well when I have to give myself the same treatment. For the second time this year, I got absolutely blindsided by someone at work today. I was setting up a workstation for a chemistry professor when the admin for his department came in and announced \"Make sure you check everything before he leaves because when they set up my stuff, nothing worked for two weeks.\" I looked at her dumbfounded.WTF? I set her up when she was hired and never got a single ticket from her afterwords. I've deployed workstations to hundreds of people on the campus and have never gotten that kind of feedback. I was embarrassed and knew better than to engage in front of the professor. I later emailed the admin and found out that part of her original issue was with her telephone, which isn't something IT handles. She doubled down on the rest of her story, though, claiming I'd left her with a laptop that couldn't access the network or print. That would be pretty difficult because part of deploying a computer is printing a page from a network printer that the user has to sign. </p>\n<p>Wonder Woman, who actually has an important, high-powered job at the same university, unlike my low-pressure, just doing it to pass the time job, did her best to talk me off the ledge. She swears that I am a well-loved and valued person who has a reputation for being super-helpful and nice. That's absolutely what I strive to do. I swear I'm not one of those mean IT guys that fusses at people. Nor am I a slacker. I'd never want to embarrass my wife or myself like that. I genuinely like helping people out with computer issues. I've been doing this for 30 years. During my career in public K-12 education, people were more professional and respectful than what I have encountered in higher ed.</p>\n<p>I wrote an angry email that I didn't send. As the hours pass, I am less and less upset, but I am still bothered. I know I am not responsible for this person's lack of social skills. I don't question my ability to do something as simple as issue a workstation to a new employee. I don't know what it will take for me to feel whole after this. I plan to talk to my boss tomorrow to ask him to have a word with this lady's boss. I fear that my boss, who is very much a \"don't make waves\" type, will opt for ignoring it, and I don't know how to handle that. I'm not working these days for the dough as much as I am to have something to get me out of the house and keep me busy. If it starts feeling like a net negative, I can just head right back into retirement.</p>\n<p>Anyway, thanks for listening/reading as I work this out in my own head.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

My mom employed tricks like using bread to stretch hamburger and making her own waffles instead of buying the ready-made kind.

On the way home, I thought how different the experience is now compared to what it was like going with my mother back in the 70s. Back then, we had dramatically fewer choices than we have today. There were two kinds of apples back in the day, red apples and yellow apples. Today, there are a dozen or more to choose from. I like watermelon. Check that. I love watermelon. I could eat it every day. Thanks to the miracle of refrigerated shipping containers. In 2024, I can eat it every day. I no longer have to wait for the middle of summer to get here before I can enjoy my favorite treat.</p>\n<p>Did you ever make a special trip to someone's house because they owned a record that you didn't have, and you just wanted to listen to a song from it? Kids these days don't have that experience. They can listen to practically any song ever recorded whenever they want to through the miracle of Spotify and Apple Music. If your budget has room for it, you can go from hearing about a book for the first time to reading it in the span of a couple of minutes, thanks to the availability of downloads from the major publishers. The same goes for movies and TV shows. We don't even mention instant gratification anymore because all gratification comes immediately, it seems.</p>\n<p>My grandmother lived most of her life in a square mile patch in a rural community in southeastern North Carolina. She never left the country, and she rarely left the state. I have grandchildren still in school who have visited Europe more times than I have. My son, who is single and has a good job, often travels to cities across the country on the weekends just to take in art museums and experience new cities.  I remember going on a field trip in the sixth grade from the small town I lived in to the state fair in Raleigh. One of my classmates was terrified as the bus crossed the bridge over the Cape Fear River. That bridge was only two miles from her home, and she had never been across it before. In so many ways, the world is much smaller today than it was in the past.</p>\n<p>Brilliant people have designed systems to make my personal information available wherever I go. From my work computer to my phone to my laptop at home, I can work on the same document and look at the same pictures with little to no effort. </p>\n<p>I can clearly remember the first time I retrieved a local weather report from a computer. When I was growing up, you could listen to the radio at a certain time of day or, better yet, wait for the six o'clock news to get a weather report. The idea that I could get one whenever I wanted to just by typing on a keyboard was miraculous, and it impressed me to no end. Even though the modern internet seems designed more to take money out of my wallet than for any other purpose, it still serves as an endless source of fascinating information available whenever I want it. Brilliant people have designed systems to make my personal information available wherever I go. From my work computer to my phone to my laptop at home, I can work on the same document and look at the same pictures with little to no effort.</p>\n<p>Like most people, I take all of this for granted and seldom take the time to consider what a true miracle it is and how rapidly it has all evolved. I even get irritated when my mind can conceive of an idea that no one has invented yet. Actually, that rarely happens. People seem to come up with ideas and make them realities faster than I can master the skills to take advantage of them.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

I use plenty of it. Many people say that when software is free, you are paying with your data. That isn't always true. There are plenty of independent developers making FOSS tools that aren't data collectors, but there are also popular programs that collect as much as they can get away with. Take the time to read the <a href='https://proton.me/blog/meta-threads-privacy#:~:text=Threads%27%20own%20privacy%20policy%20is,that%20aren%27t%20entirely%20clear.'>privacy policy from Threads</a>, the Meta microblogging platform. Sometimes, you just can't find certain features in free software, and you have to rely on a paid product. No one likes to pay full price, so here are a few places to get name - brand software titles at a discount.</p>\n<h2 id=student-app-centre>Student App Centre</h2><p><a href='https://www.studentappcentre.com/'>Student App Centre</a> is a paid, but cheap service that provides discounts on more than 200 well-known software titles to anyone with an education affiliation who can verify it via email or providing documentation. I'm nether a student, nor a member of the faculty, but I am employed by a university and that qualifies me. Some of their popular titles are Downie, Better Display, Little Snitch, Al Dente, Cleanshot X and Parallels. A membership is $21.40.</p>\n<h2 id=bundle-hunt>Bundle Hunt</h2><p><a href='https://bundlehunt.com/'>Bundle Hunt</a> is a website that periodically offers 40–50 titles at the time for very steep discounts. I have purchased dozens of programs from them over the years. They email you download links and serial numbers for your purchases, but they also have an online database for you to reference. I recently re-downloaded an app I bought nine years ago. Some of the current titles they have on sale are Mountain Duck, MacPilot, MonsterWriter and Smultron.</p>\n<h2 id=app-sumo>App Sumo</h2><p><a href='https://appsumo.com'>App Sumo</a> specializes in business software, although they sometimes have consumer titles and training discounts available. Their titles include apps for SEO, static website creation, CRMs, email marketing and lead generation among many others.</p>\n<h2 id=setapp>Setapp</h2><p><a href='https://go.setapp.com/invite/kmjmclw4'>Setapp</a> is a $9.99 service that lets you download, install and use over 250 quality Mac apps. I currently have over 40 of their apps downloaded. They offer some of the most highly rated programs in the Mac ecosystem, including Bartender, Default Folder X, CleanShot X, CleanMyMac, Dropzone, Downie, Permute, Houdah Spot, Mind Node, Pathfinder, Soulver, Ulysses and MarsEdit. I can't recommend them highly enough.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

It&#39;s been around for over a decade and I\nhave never known it to go down. Automattic is the company behind Word\nPress and Day One, so it&#39;s no fly-by-night enterprise. </p>\n\n<p>One of the primary benefits of using Simplenote is the speed. It syncs\nbehind the scenes and opens quickly, regardless of platform. Each note\nhas a history, and you can view changes you&#39;ve made to it over time.\nNotes are easy to share on a Mac using the system share sheet. If you\ndon&#39;t have access to a device on which you have Simplenote installed,\nyou can get to your notes in a browser. </p>\n\n<p>Notes in Simplenote are organized by tags. Use as many as you want. You\ncan also do simple searches of your notes via text strings. Simplenote\nis compatible with Apple&#39;s new writing tools, which means you have\naccess to dictation, proofreading, rewriting, spelling and grammar\ncorrection. Information about each note, including creation date,\nmodification date, character count and word count is available at the\nclick of a button. Like most modern apps, Simplenote has a light and\ndark mode. You can also control the default text size. Important notes\ncan be pinned to the top of your notes list. </p>\n\n<p>The Simplenote API is open to developers. There are several other\nnote-taking apps on various platforms that can access your notes\ndatabase. On such app is <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/cpbotha/nvpy\">nvPY</a> for macOS.</p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Simplenote - Free, Rock Solid and Dependable for Over a Decade' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

December is one of my favorite months, particularly now that I am in higher ed. Our final exams were last week and the students are gone until the middle of January. The only ones left on campus are our contingent of international students on Davis scholarships, most of whom cannot afford to fly back to their country of origin for the holidays. In the IT department, the first part of the month is reserved for projects we can't do while school is in session. This year we are replacing wireless access points in a couple of buildings, which involves much climbing of ladders and talking on radios to make sure the new devices come online.</p>\n<p>On the personal side, even though we are not religious, Wonder Woman and I still have a tree and decorations inside the house. My only contribution to that happening is carrying the boxes of supplies from under the house into the living room and then getting out of the way. She gets everything put up efficiently and quickly because that's the way she moves through life. She gets things accomplished while I am still deciding how to get started. Today I worked on a couple of my own projects while she did her thing while Christmas music filled our living room.</p>\n<p>We, and by we, once again I mean she, buys all the Christmas gifts online. We are not the type of people to go bargain hunting in crowded stores with crowded parking lots. For a couple of weeks at the beginning of the month, we come home to what we call \"papages,\" a word coined by our grandson for the boxes the man in the brown truck leaves on your porch. Then, in one marathon session, she wraps them all and puts them under the tree. My part is staying out of the way.</p>\n<p>I enjoy some special foods during the season. I am partial to Clementines, the small, easy to peel tangerines and lots of salty country ham and southern style biscuits. Although I love the taste of eggnog, I avoid it because it reminds me too much of my drinking days, when I used to have it with bourbon at Christmas. My sobriety date is December 28, so the last days of my drinking career sadly happened during Christmas of 2008.</p>\n<p>Our travel during the holidays is pre-determined and has changed little over the course of our marriage. On Christmas Eve, we gather at my in-laws, who live near the coast. They are of Italian heritage, so the big meal is lasagna. After we eat and exchange gifts that evening, Wonder Woman and I will drive another couple of hours up the coast to my mother's. She is a widow and without us would be alone. We will spend the night with her and visit some in the morning before making the drive across the state to my daughter's house.</p>\n<p>We often take a getaway trip during the holidays, usually to the mountains. This fall, our favorite mountain towns were all extensively damaged by the flooding resulting from Hurricane Helene. The town of Asheville just started pumping potable water two weeks ago. As a result, this year we are traveling down to Savannah, Georgia to enjoy its delights. We thought about taking the train, but our recent Amtrak experiences have not been positive, so we are going to drive.<br />\nWhatever your December plans happen to be, I hope you get some time off and an opportunity to relax and to see your family if that brings you joy.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

As I was updating and cleaning up my RSS feeds, I saw many people talking about their default apps as a result of an episode of the <a href='https://hemisphericviews.com'>podcast Hemispheric Views.</a>. I learned about a lot of great software that I'd missed out on during my hiatus. I wanted to get in on the fun as well, so I started a blog for that express purpose, and the rest is history.</p>\n<p>A full 12 months have passed, and some apps have been replaced or discarded over time.

I&#39;m old, so I have more accounts than I know what to do\nwith. When it comes to cloud storage, I have access to Google Drive, One\nDrive, Box and Dropbox, although I only pay for Google Drive. I once\nsigned up an entire middle school&#39;s faculty to Dropbox with my referral\nlink, so I have a large sized free tier. I got 50GB from Box so long ago\nthat I no longer remember how. OneDrive is provided by my job.</p>\n\n<p>Each of these providers, along with other cloud storage solutions,\nprovide their own software for mounting your storage at login. There&#39;s\nno way I want to have four separate apps running in the background when\nI can consolidate them into one app that does the same thing and in some\ncases provides more utility. Mac users can choose between three types of\naccess. I prefer using a network drive mapper. The app I use is\nCloudMounter because it is included in Setapp, although it often goes on\nsale.

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/lou-2.webp\" alt=\"Lou\" /></p>\n<p>It's early December. The sun is setting about as early as it ever does. I don't know about you, but it's very nearly dark by the time I get home from work. It's been about a month since an election that shocked and saddened many people. Politically, things are happening exactly like we knew they would when Trump won. The felon is nominating other criminals for jobs. So far, he's selected over a dozen current and former staffers from Fox News for government positions. There are less than 20 shopping days until Christmas, if you're into that. Hopefully, you aren't an employee of UPS or FedEx because December has to be the hell month of all hell months for those folks. One more year and we will be halfway through the 2020s. How in the hell is that even possible?</p>\n<p>The people reading this are an eclectic bunch. One big group is my family. We are loyal, and also we like to know what's going on with each other. There are the folks I know in real life who see these links on social media and stop in from time to time. Then there are my Internet friends, many of them bloggers themselves. We have a sort of mutual support group where we read each other's blogs. Finally, there are a bunch of Internet strangers who know me through one of my many passions, but most likely through my witty political commentary or through my many posts about all things technical on the Mac side of the house.</p>\n<p>If you are reading this, and we are strangers, feel free to introduce yourself. I take pride in answering every email I get. I follow most folks back on social media, too. Likewise, I may not always have the best in-person social skills, but I'm generally pretty nice on the Internet. I want to make sure that folks have someone to talk to during what are really some frightening times, and for many lonely ones to boot.</p>\n<p>Please let me know how you are holding up after the election. Are you scared? I am. Are you mad? I am that too. Do you like the holiday season, or is it stressful for you? I'm on the side that likes it. I get a good long break from work. I like my family, and I am happy to spend extra time with them during the holidays. Even though Wonder Woman and I have a whole pile of kids and grandkids, we can afford to remember them all. It wasn't always like that. If you struggle with that part of the equation, I will understand.</p>\n<p>Do you have any plans for the new year, any resolutions you are thinking about making? I want to be able to go on longer walks again myself. I'm hoping to take a fun trip with Wonder Woman in 2025, and I don't want to have to stay behind while she goes for runs or climbs mountains, not that I will be doing either of those things, but I would like to have some leisurely lakeside strolls. Not only that, but I am also contemplating retiring for good. I like the financial freedom working my post-career job brings, but there is more to give life meaning than one's occupation.<br />\nThe universe is neutral. It doesn't hate you, but it certainly doesn't love you. The Internet can be a frightening morass of noise at times. There are people trying to cut through that. Personal independent bloggers offer little pieces of themselves all over the place. Some of them are quite funny. Others are strident but will give you real food for thought. If you take time to investigate this little slice of the online world, you're almost guaranteed to find someone who resonates with you. If you can't, please let me know and I will offer you some suggestions.</p>\n<p>It's tempting sometimes to create an online persona, but it isn't worth the effort. Just be you. You have value, and you're special because you are unique. Don't try to model yourself on some plastic influencer. Live your life and share the parts you feel comfortable sharing. Start a blog.

I was constantly hungry, desperately trying to take in more calories than I was using making my way north through the Appalachian Mountains. More often than not, my go to order when I was lucky enough to find a diner or a deli while passing through the small mountain trail towns was the humble hamburger. There was a place in Hot Springs, NC that had a burger called the Hiker Special weighing in at 12 oz of ground beef. I ate two of them.</p>\n<p>I still enjoy hamburgers and other sandwiches of all kinds. My favorite fast food-ish restaurant is <a href='https://www.jerseymikes.com'>Jersey Mike's Sub Shop</a> where i get the #13 Italian fixed the traditional way plus banana peppers. They have gluten free bread for Wonder Woman who sticks with the lower calorie turkey and provolone.</p>\n<p>Other than liverwurst, I've never met a sandwich I didn't like. They are best with good fresh bread and the toppings piled on, but I've eaten many, many plain bologna and cheese sandwiches on loaf bread in my day.</p>\n<p>Here's the fascinating story behind some of the most popular sandwiches in America.</p>\n<p><a href='https://heritagefoods.com/blogs/news/the-history-of-the-hamburger?srsltid=AfmBOopoZAS_V1w0zKg-dRp8SChDVltWPc3h-Iwa_V_5gLUq51W0Dwqp'>The History of the Hamburger</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://www.saveur.com/reuben-sandwich-origin-history/'>Who Really Invented the Reuben? | Saveur</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://www.elmesondepepe.com/ultimate-cuban-sandwich/'>Cuban Sandwich: The Complete History and Guide</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://thecommittedpig.com/history-grilled-cheese/'>The History of the Grilled Cheese | The Committed Pig | NJ</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://www.tastingtable.com/1216676/the-fried-bologna-sandwich-is-a-southern-classic/'>The Fried Bologna Sandwich Is A Southern Classic</a>\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/10-1.webp\" alt=\"Door kicked open by workers\" /></p>\n<p>In September 1991, I was working first shift at the medium-sized prison that had employed me for the previous five years. My co-workers were a mixed group of white folks, African Americans, Native Americans and one officer from Puerto Rico. Most of us had served in the military. Almost none of us had any college. Our spouses worked in various places: the few remaining textile mills, a Converse shoe plant and various chicken and turkey processing facilities, including Imperial Foods, located in Hamlet, NC, about 30 miles away. We'd finished the inmates' breakfast meal and were in the process of getting the prison through its daily cleaning when the switchboard starting putting through calls to the officers wive's who worked at Imperial. Something bad had happened, a fire. Over 100 firefighters had been called in, and the news was grim. There were many, many people on route to the hospital, many missing and the first bodies were being brought out. We had to call in people from second shift to come in early, so the worried husbands could get to the site of the fire.</p>\n<p>During the next few days, the survivors began to tell the story of the rapidly spreading fire that was fueled by an ad hoc repair to a hydraulic line that burst right next to a sizzling hot fryer for cooking chicken. Few people knew that although the plant had two previous fires within the last decade, it had never had a state safety inspection. As the workers fled, they encountered locked and chained fire exits, closed at the order of the company's owner, who was worried about people stealing food from his company. Only one group of employees managed to kick open a door. That door, covered in sooty boot prints, is on display today at the museum of American History in Washington, DC. It bears testament to one of the deadliest industrial disasters in state history. Of the 90 people inside Imperial Foods when the fire broke out, 25 died and 54 were injured, many of them suffering lifelong ill effects from smoke and chemical inhalation.</p>\n<p>Eventually, the owner of the plant, Emmet Roe was charged with 25 counts of manslaughter, He pled guilty and was sentenced to 20 years, of which he served only four. He was also fined the equivalent of $1.8 million. The plant was permanently closed. Based in part on public outrage, Jim Martin, only the state's second Republican governor in 100 years, nearly doubled the number of industrial inspectors to make workplace inspections more common.</p>\n<p>The Hamlet fire is remarkable because it actually resulted in some accountability and change. For years, American companies scoffed at toothless safety laws and the relative impotence of inspectors. Paying fines was easier than paying for safe working conditions. There is an ongoing and concerted effort currently under way to cut through the so-called red tape of government regulations that supposedly make it too difficult to do business. Many of the regulations are ones created for worker safety. The state of Texas repealed a regulation that mandated water breaks for outdoor workers in the middle of a record-breaking heatwave of 100+ degree days. It interfered with worker productivity.</p>\n<p>Even before the US elected a 34x convicted felon to be its president, most people were already aware of the two tiered justice system under which this country operates. We saw Bill Cosby released from prison despite evidence of dozens of sexual assaults. We saw Trump pardon crony after crony. Even in the local news in my hometown, there have long been reports of the wives of generals from the nearby Army base, Ft. Liberty (née Bragg) getting traffic tickets fixed, of the sons of prominent businessmen getting caught with drugs and guns at a public school and getting away scott free. The owner of a local car dealership not only bought his way out of charges for sexually abusing a 14-year-old boy, the judge would not allow the records of the court proceedings to be made public in violation of state open records laws. It's an old story and one that gets repeated frequently.</p>\n<p>When I see a rich and powerful person get real justice and pay a tangible price for decisions that have had horrible effects on working-class people, I really don't care whether the punishment was extrajudicial or not. The system we have is designed not to punish the powerful, but to keep the poor in line. Eat the rich doesn't have to be an idle threat.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/linkage/022x-resized.webp\" alt=\"CEO_murder\" /></p>\n<p>It's common knowledge that the for-profit medical industrial complex in the United States is broken and has been so for a long time. Bills are inscrutable. Insurance companies provide little help when trying to determine the cost of care patients are considering, if they have that luxury. There may be occasional bright spots, but almost everyone who deals with the system has a personal horror story. For-profit companies are beholden to their stockholders, not patients, you know—sick people. Even non-profits have dubious decision-making skills. I am in long-term (16-year) recovery from substance abuse. I have a mood disorder that requires me to take medication daily. It's no big deal. I was diagnosed in the '80s, so I've dealt with it almost all my adult life. I once got a letter from my insurance company that explained they noticed how expensive my medication was. They suggested I ask the doctor to prescribe Valium instead, a highly addictive and often abused drug. They suggested that to me, a recovering addict.</p>\n<p>I dealt with bone-on-bone arthritis for years. The only relief was a shot that I could get every six months. The red tape, delays, and stalling by my insurance company (I was a state employee in NC) would often result in delays of two to three months, stretching the time between shots up to nine months. Arthritis is a painful and debilitating condition that doesn't just get better. The policies of a company trying to save money resulted in my being denied coverage I was promised as part of my employment. I lived in pain and grew depressed when I met so many stone walls. This went on for years.</p>\n<p>I am sorry that the CEO of United Healthcare was murdered in the street outside of a meeting for investors in that company. I am not surprised, though. If I thought some exorbitantly paid executive was responsible for the pain, suffering, and death of someone I loved because his company was trying to provide maximum value to shareholders, I might just consider violence myself.</p>\n<p><a href='https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-03-health-ceos-rake-millions.html'>Health insurance CEOs rake in millions: Here's the top 10 list</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://archive.ph/JFUgz'>How Insurance Companies Get You to Pay Higher Costs for Less Coverage</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://perfectunion.us/whistleblower-exposes-health-insurance-companies-most-evil-scheme/'>Whistleblower Exposes Health Insurers' Most Evil Scheme</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://akasa.com/blog/3-medical-billing-horror-stories-that-prove-the-healthcare-revenue-cycle-is-way-too-complicated/'>3 Medical Billing Horror Stories that Prove the Healthcare Revenue Cycle Is Way Too Complicated | AKASA</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/health-insurance-horror-stories/2/'>Health insurance horror stories</a><BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/05-1.webp\" alt=\"Good Old Days\" /></p>\n<p>I am not one of those people who longs for the good old days. For big groups of people, the progress made in gender equity, civil rights, LGBT rights and other areas was much too hard fought to ever consider going back. I am very fond of progress, technology and medical advances. I'm happy to live in a time when HIV is no longer a death sentence. Likewise, I resent the hell out of the empty-headed RFK's of the world who poison people's minds with their anti-vax rhetoric. Having said all of that, I will admit to missing little pieces of the past.</p>\n<p>I miss affordable prices a lot. Getting any beverage in a restaurant costs several dollars. I saw an app today that does one simple thing for Mac users. It toggles a feature (the FN key) on and off. The developer was asking a modest twenty-five dollars for the privilege of using it. As someone who has owned several thousand-dollar cars and who currently drives a 2005 Camry, I am outraged at the people who think a $30K car is cheap. The margin on simple things like shoes and eyeglass frames is robbery by another name. Going to the movies, a concert or a ball game is outrageous. I know, I know. Get off my lawn.</p>\n<p>I miss the time when our society wasn't polarized about politics the way it is today. Sorry, Obama, there definitely is a red America and a blue America. I can't even.</p>\n<p>I miss the time when people could live off a single income earned by a high school graduate. I supported my wife and son in the 80s by framing houses and serving in the National Guard. Twenty-five years later, my youngest daughter and her husband both worked full-time and had a lower standard of living than we did back in the day. </p>\n<p>Oddly enough, in my own experience, racial self-segregation was less pronounced in the 80s than it is now. At my high school, the sports teams, student government and clubs were all diverse. Over the past forty years, I've watched the younger generation choose to have white and black clubs and white and black activities. Other POC just try to get in where they fit in. By the time my kids got to high school, the football team was almost all POC, while the cheerleading squad was lily-white.</p>\n<p>I miss the days when security wasn't the overarching, ever present concern in tech. The impediment to efficiency at work because of security is huge. We can't put local admin accounts with static passwords on workstations to facilitate getting access to them. They have to use a server generated rotating password that I have to look up whenever I need to do something. I can't even use an admin account to log in on my own computer (on the PC side). I have to elevate privileges using my super-extra long admin password to each app I need. Two-factor authentication is neat, as long as it works. The aggravation of dealing with people who get new phones or have other hardware issues is just another wrinkle. Passkeys seem neat until you try to use them when you work on multiple devices.</p>\n<p>Like I said initially, I don't want to go back. I don't think life was better 40 years ago, but that doesn't mean every change has been positive.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

Having been involved with social movements and protests over the last quarter of a century, I'm aware of the conservative attitude towards any group of people who don't wrap themselves in the flag. Modern police forces are terrified of ANTIFA and anarchists while they simultaneously ignore or tacitly support right-wing groups. Republican led legislatures across the country have passed laws designed to crack down on protests and those laws are always enforced selectively against POC, the poor, young people and anyone who opposes the power structure. Some states have made it legal for drivers to run over protesters who block traffic, essentially creating a de facto death penalty. Such is the morality of the \"all lives matter\" crowd.</p>\n<p>For information about role models from the past, see these links.</p>\n<p><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_resistance_to_Nazism'>German resistance to Nazism - Wikipedia</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/german-resistance-to-hitler'>German Resistance to Hitler | Holocaust Encyclopedia</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/brief-history-anti-fascism-180975152/'>A Brief History of Anti-Fascism | Smithsonian</a><BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

This little\napp allows you to toggle the behavior simply be pressing and holding the\nFN key for three seconds. You definitely want to find this app on sale\nthough. It is regularly priced at a whopping $25 . It is currently\navailable at <a\nhref=\"https://bundlehunt.com/bundle/2024-blackfriday-macos-bundle\">Bundlehunt</a>\nfor $1.50.</p>\n\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/quill-notes-app/id6496970950?mt=12\">Quill</a>\n- Quill is a menu bar notes app similar to <a\nhref=\"https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/scrap-paper\">Scrap Paper</a>and\n<a\nhref=\"https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/scratchpad-floating-notes-but-better\">Scratchpad</a>\nwith one big difference, you can use images in Quill notes. The notes\nsync across Macs, but there isn&#39;t an iOS app. You can, however, export\nyour Quill notes easily enough if you want to view them on your phone.\nIt is $.99 in the App Store.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://trace-app.pages.dev/\">Trace</a> - Trace is a minimalist\ntime tracking app. When you manually start a session of, it records the\napps you work on and the time you spend in them.

It Neither Loves Nor Hates You</strong> - I am all for the power of positive thinking. I tend to act as if things are going to turn out my way most of the time. Pessimistic people, and you surely know a Debbie Downer or two, are a drag to be around, and they grate on my nerves after a while. I am not a Pollyanna, though. I do not believe that \"everything will be all right\" because I am fully aware that I could be in a car accident on the way home or that my house could burn down tonight. Bad things happen to good people every day. What I believe, based on evidence, is my absolute ability to deal with whatever happens. I have a proven track record of living through everything that has ever happened to me. Everything can be overcome. If you don't believe that, read <em>Mans Search for Meaning</em> about how concentration camp inmates survived.</p>\n<p><strong>People Are the Most Powerful When They Are Organized</strong> - Most of the rights and privileges we enjoy today, our freedoms, if you will, were not won on the battlefield. They were won on picket lines and in mass movements against the entrenched power structure. The rights of women, people of color, children, workers and the 99% were won by organized groups of people who strategized, struggled and fought and sometimes died to demand rights we take for granted today. The powerful know this and do their best to keep us divided along racial, cultural and class lines so that we won't do it again.</p>\n<p><strong>It Is Possible to Overcome Nature and Nurture</strong> - We are not locked into an immutable set of values instilled in us by our genetics or our environment. Free will is a hell of a drug, to paraphrase Rick James. I am a son of the South. I have been surrounded by conservative Christianity, institutional white supremacy, patriarchal behavior patterns and unquestioning nationalism my entire life, but I am not an adherent to any of it. The easier and softer way is to go with the flow. Don't make waves. Accept the status quo. Countless people can't even define their belief system because they are too damned busy getting ready for the next MCU movie or the coming weekend's football games. I'm sure there are areas where I need to increase my awareness too, but I try as best I can to be a part of the solution to society's problems. I am not neutral about much.</p>\n<p><strong>Curiosity and Sense of Humor are The Most Attractive Human Traits</strong> - I'm not an education major. I haven't studied learning styles, but I know there are plenty of ways to add to one's personal knowledge base. Whether it's reading books, surfing the Internet, interrogating the people in your life, or something else, there are an infinite number of things to learn. People who have a sense of wonder and a thirst for knowledge are my favorites. When that is coupled with the ability to laugh, to see the absurd, and to enjoy little moments of serendipity, it's hard for me not to be drawn towards a person.</p>\n<p><strong>When You Live a Fearful Life, You're Living Like All the Bad Things Have Already Happened to You</strong> - I am firmly in the camp with those who believe that asking for forgiveness is easier than asking for permission. I do not have on ongoing CYA strategy at work or in my private life. There is something inauthentic and sad about people who constantly self-censor or wait for others to make decisions for them. Granted, I am not rich nor am I a CIO. What I am is generally happy and productive, with plenty of room in my mind for things that I enjoy. I believe in acting in good faith. My experience has shown me that doing so is what works for me, more so than endless plotting to get ahead and avoid ruffling feathers. I feel confident that I can defend most of what I do to anyone who questions it.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

Within moments there was a massive police presence on the field. The police tried to separate the players, and when they didn't immediately comply, some of the officers deployed pepper spray - against student-athletes on national television. It wasn't a good look.</p>\n<p>I've never been a police officer, but I worked within the criminal justice system for seven years as a correctional officer, spending eight hours a day with convicted criminals so I have some understanding of the stress of the job. Not everyone is cut out to be a cop. If you are easily frightened, angered or slow to make important decisions, being a police officer is probably not the job for you. There is no shame in that. Unfortunately, the US court system is set up in a way that allows police to assert that they fear for the safety to justify just about any action up to murdering children holding play toys.</p>\n<p>Nationwide there is an issue with sub-standard police officers moving from one agency to another as they get fired for incompetence or misconduct. President Trump has promised to give police blanket immunity for crimes they commit, regardless of the circumstances. Under his policies, police will be free to choke people to death whenever they feel like it without ever facing justice. The evidence proves that they will do exactly that.</p>\n<p><a href='https://centerforjusticeresearch.org/research_briefs/national-police-misconduct-database/'>National Police Misconduct Database - Center for Justice Research</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3QMvVeFTrw'>10 Outrageous Police Misconduct: A Compilation of Videos - YouTube</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/faculty_scholarship/4004/'>\"The Wandering Officer\" by Ben Grunwald and John Rappaport</a>\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

I usually run about 40-50 myself. I&#39;ve tried\nseveral solutions to quickly find the tab I&#39;m looking for without much\nsuccess. Since installing <a\nhref=\"https://anybox.ltd/browser-deputy\">Browser Deputy,</a> I&#39;ve been\npleased with the way it incorporates into my workflow.

I use <a\nhref=\"https://www.popsci.com/diy/how-to-remove-ai-google-search/\">a\ncustom Google search</a> that removes all the AI crud and provides the\ngood old ten blue links that we once took for granted. It was easy to\nadd to the list.</p>\n\n<p>The other useful feature in Browser Deputy is the ability to search menu\ncommands in whatever open app you happen to be in, not just browsers. It\ndoesn&#39;t give you a heads-up display of the commands like <a\nhref=\"https://sergii.tatarenkov.name/keyclu/support/\">KeyClu</a>, but it\nwill activate any command you search for.</p>\n\n<p>Browser Deputy is available for download from the <a\nhref=\"https://anybox.ltd/browser-deputy\">dev&#39;s website</a>.

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/47-2.webp\" alt=\"We_are_more\" /></p>\n<p>A few years ago, a man in his 60s here in NC, an amateur cyclist of some renown, won a race against a field of mostly younger riders. He was selected for a random drug test, which he failed. In his quest to remain competitive, the man, who was already legendary in the local racing community, a mentor to many and a man held in high esteem, resorted to cheating to increase his chances of winning a relatively meaningless bicycle race. In the process, he made the news, was banned from racing and severely damaged a hard-earned reputation. When I heard about it, I was livid. I didn't know the man. I knew of him. Some of my friends frequently made the one-hour trip to his hometown to train with him. Everyone called him The Old Man. My attempt to carry on a lifelong love affair with sports was already severely damaged by the steroid era in baseball. I adopted pro cycling as my new favorite, only to discover that almost every famous racer of the era was a cheat. It deeply affected me then and now.</p>\n<p>I took to social media to vent, as one does. I guy who knows me and The Old Man asked me a question that stuck with me about the whole situation. Is it fair to judge someone solely for the worst thing they have ever done? Is it? Society does it routinely in criminal justice cases. Sure, they take some mitigating circumstances into account, but if you mess up bad enough, you are going to prison despite your otherwise saintly life. I knew more than one person serving a life sentence when I worked in the correctional system who had but a single yet horrible conviction.</p>\n<p>In the army, a well-worn but true statement is that one “oh shit” wipes out one hundred “attaboys.” People remember Bill Buckner a lot more for making an error in the World Series than they do for his otherwise illustrious career. In my own tiny little personal Internet, one developer's failure to adequately address a mistake is still reverberating in our community months after the fact.</p>\n<p>I suspect that in moments of absolute honesty, most of us could make a confession that could potentially turn large swaths of our acquaintances against us. Maybe we bullied someone or we were needlessly unkind when we didn't have to be. Perhaps as ignorant and uninformed youngsters, we indulged in behavior that we are ashamed of now, like listening to Rush Limbaugh or voting for Reagan.</p>\n<p>I believe in extending grace to my fellow humans these days to the extent that I am able. I believe, as I said, that everyone has that one worst thing, and I try not to define people by that. If they are serial assholes, I let them go on their way, but in most cases, people aren't that way. I learned in 12-Step recovery that resentments against other people are the number one offenders in a person's life who is trying to stay sober. I was a miserable person with a whole pile of grievances 16 years ago. In the intervening time, I've worked hard to become forgiving, not for anyone's sake but my own. It's liberating and a heartily recommend it. You aren't letting your ex off the hook when you stop centering on your grievances, You are letting yourself off.</p>\n<p>I'm not one who preaches against being judgmental. Frankly, I think using your judgment is a survival skill, and it is impossible not to exercise it. You can't stick with the winners if you don't decide who they are. So judge away, but be careful what you do with your decisions. Don't write people off as a matter of course. Offer them a silent chance at redemption if you can.

Sometimes there are a few identifiable causes, but I know that on better days, they would not bother me.

Two of the most hated apps by the little uninformed Russian trolls over there happen to be two I like just fine, Bartender and Clean My Mac.

It seems like the only people not participating are the Linux people who could solve all our problems if we would just install Arch/Mint/Ubuntu/Gnome etc.</p>\n<p>On top of the technology drama, I also had to leave home, not something I always enjoy, accompanying Wonder Woman to the supermarket.

Lately,\n<a href=\"https://languagetool.org/\">LanguageTool</a> has surged in\npopularity. It is integrated into many well-known writing apps across\nmultiple platforms, including macOS and iOS.</p>\n\n<p>Professionally, I am tasked with composing Confluence (knowledge base)\ndocuments for Jira, the ticketing system my job uses. Personally, I\nmaintain three blogs as a non-monetized blogs as a hobby. I write a lot\nas a result. I have been using the free version of LanguageTool for a\ncouple of months. It does a better job than the native spell checkers I\npreviously used, and it helps with things like missing commas and\nomitted words. I took advantage of a Black Friday sale to sign up for a\nyear on the Pro Plan. As a result, the app now has a much larger range\nof tools for me to use.</p>\n\n<p>LanguageTool has a plugin for Safari, Firefox and Chromium browsers. It\nhas a tool specifically built for Microsoft Office, Google Docs, Apple&#39;s\nPages and LibreOffice. For email users, it works with Apple Mail,\nOutlook, Thunderbird and Gmail. It even has a plugin for Obsidian, where\nI do most of my writing. On a Mac, it is also optimized for uses in\nother apps like Messages and Notes. There is a native editor app for Mac\nusers.</p>\n\n<p>Language Tools&#39;s capabilities are sizable.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<em>Grammar</em><ul>\n<li>Word order</li>\n<li>Verb tenses</li>\n<li>Subject/verb agreement</li>\n<li>Commas and in-depth punctuation</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p></li>\n<li>\n<em>Style</em><ul>\n<li>Repetition</li>\n<li>Over-used words and phrases</li>\n<li>Wordiness</li>\n<li>Foreign terms</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<em>Semantics</em><ul>\n<li>Lack of clarity</li>\n<li>Word confusion</li>\n<li>Double negatives</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<em>Format and Typography</em><ul>\n<li>Consistency for numbers and letters</li>\n<li>Spacing</li>\n<li>Time and date formats</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<em>Spelling</em><ul>\n<li>Misspelled names and acronyms</li>\n<li>Casing errors</li>\n<li>Easy to import your Mac&#39;s personal dictionary</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p>LanguageTool works not just with English, but with many other languages\nas well. It provides detailed stats on what it has done to aid you in\nwriting. You can use a limited feature set or turn on what it calls\n&quot;picky mode&quot; for more frequent suggestions to strengthen your writing.\nIt does not duplicate what macOS and ChatGPT offer in so far as it does\nnot change the tone of your writing, but it will paraphrase sentences\nfor you.</p>\n\n<p>I am pleased so far with the suggestions I receive from LanguageTool. It\ndefinitely makes what I write more polished. It is not a cheap tool.\nWithout the Black Friday discount, it is $5.83 a month, or $70 a year.\nCasual users can get plenty of benefits from the free plan, while\nstudents or more serious writers can benefit from deciding to go pro.</p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Language Tool - Free is Good, Paid is Better, but Expensive' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/40-1.webp\" alt=\"Mac VSPC\" /></p>\n<p>I don't want to stir up any trouble. I really don't. I am here to be as helpful as possible for people who are trying to make purchasing decisions about the technology they are going to acquire during this holiday season. Not only that, but I was perusing social media during lunch and lo and behold, I saw the decades old debate about the suitability of Apple computers and computers running Windows, raging on the same as ever. I thought folks were over this, but evidently, they are not.</p>\n<p>I started using personal computers in 1993. My first computer was an IBM 486 with Windows 3.1 installed. Over the next six years, I went from a novice to someone working in the support industry. The first time I received a call from a person who owned a Macintosh computer and wanted my assistance, I was incredulous. I couldn't believe that someone spent their money on something so expensive and so incompatible with everything with which I was familiar. In 2000, I was hired by a local school system, issued an Apple laptop, and immediately put to work servicing thousands of Apple computers across 21 schools. Within six months, my ability to configure and maintain Macs surpassed what I had learned in six years as a Windows user. Because I had to support both platforms, my knowledge of Windows and how to maintain it has never faltered. Although I haven't purchased a Windows machine for personal use in over a quarter of a century, I have been issued a few at work and touched literally thousands of them in my job.</p>\n<p>For a while, purchasing a Mac was a considerable investment when compared to obtaining an entry-level PC. I will admit to buying inexpensive Dell laptops for my daughters when they were in college. My mother, on the other hand, who is more financially secure, is the one person I recommended buying a Mac. The Dell PC she previously had during the early part of the 21st century was repeatedly infected with different forms of malware and hard for her to maintain. Since she entered the Apple ecosystem with an iPhone, an iMac, and an iPad, she's had very little problems, and like many users, has actually moved away from a desktop machine to using only handheld devices. Some tech snobs think that Apple locks you into their ecosystem by tying the devices together, but I can assure you that most regular people appreciate rather than resent that feature.</p>\n<p>These days, you can get an entry-level MacBook Air or a Mac Mini for under a thousand dollars, and the days of them being prohibitively expensive are over. Most people find that an entry-level PC purchased at Best Buy or Walmart will disintegrate within three or four years, whereas most Macs last up to a decade before they need to be replaced. Sometimes people that have never used anything but Windows will accuse Max of not being user-friendly, but the problem there lies with the user and not with the device. For 20 years, I watched five-year-old kindergarteners sit down at iMacs in a computer lab and begin to do things immediately. One little known fact is that low-end computers purchased in big box stores do not have the same components that other computers made by the same manufacturer enjoy. Period. There is definitely a trend towards awarding parts contracts to the lowest bidders, and certainly not to the ones who provide the most quality outside the gaming machines that some PC users purchase. Apple computers, on the other hand, enjoy the same quality components regardless of where they are sold.</p>\n<p>There are still people who believe that Macs are only good for graphic designers and creators. These same people believe that you must purchase a Windows machine to get real work done. I have news for them. I work at a small private university in the IT department. My job consists primarily of supporting Windows users and maintaining the computers on the university network. I use various Microsoft tools to do this. All of my IT related work is done on an iMac. If I need to use Windows, I simply log in via a virtual machine on the network to get access to the tools I need. The big graphics companies like Adobe have long made versions of their software for both Mac and PCs. Most of the time, outside specialized enterprise applications, users can get their work done regardless of the platform that they are on. Our university requires every student to purchase a computer, but we do not specify whether they must buy a Microsoft product or an Apple product.</p>\n<p>I am long past considering the type of computer one uses as criteria for evaluating their worthiness as a human being. It's just a machine. People who are fighting religious wars over computing platforms need to get a life. They are stuck in another decade. Having said that, I don't see a compelling reason to use Windows outside the specialty enterprise applications I mentioned earlier or just because one is familiar with the platform. I think a legitimate argument can be made for the superiority of Apple's operating systems and the apps that run on them by most knowledgeable people.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

It has built in sorting rules for 19 different types of files,\nincluding folders. These rules can be toggled on or off, but you cannot\nedit them. In addition, you can make your own very granular rules. The\nexample they give is representative of the power of the app. &quot;Move all\nfiles with the extension “DOCX” that contain the word “invoice” and were\nlast modified in the past year to a folder labeled “Invoices.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>What&#39;s remarkable is the speed at which Folder Tidy operates. It uses\nmacOS technology called Grand Central Dispatch to use all available\ncores to accomplish the tasks you assign it. In my case, it took about a\nsecond to sort and move directories with hundreds of different media\nfiles to subfolders on a different drive. I had to do some\ntroubleshooting after it failed to move all the files on the first try.\nIt turns out that my Spotlight database needed to be rebuilt, a problem\nI&#39;ve had before which also affects some search utilities, like Houdah\nSpot, that rely on it.</p>\n\n<p>Folder Tidy is not a replacement for Hazel. While it does what it sets\nout to do quickly and well, it is a file sorting utility that doesn&#39;t\nhave the depth of actions that Hazel does. If you already own Hazel,\nthere is no reason to add Folder Tidy. One other important thing to know\nis that Folder Tidy is a manual app. It doesn&#39;t watch folders and run\naction on the enclosed items automatically. </p>\n\n<p>I paid $2.49 for the app on Black Friday. It is ordinarily $9.99.</p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Folder Tidy - On Demand Fast Power' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

I hoped they would, but I had very little idea however all of this works. Blogging challenges were a mystery to me. My knowledge about how the whole community of personal bloggers from various platforms coalesces within social media circles was scant. The more I wrote and the more consistently I shared, the more learned about the unwritten expectations I would begin to place on myself. I also saw the constraints other people operated under, by choice, and how they differed from mine. Instinctively, I understood that being true to myself was the most important rule to follow. The other unwritten rules of blogging are just things I intuited along the way.</p>\n<p>To my delight, I learned that writing my own version of someone else's idea is totally fine, as long as I give them a shout-out for the inspiration. Having someone do the reverse for me is high praise. Any time I've written something and then been able to read someone else's experiences in the same set of circumstances, it's been enjoyable. I end up feeling a particular closeness to the writer. I like it best when there are other significant differences in our lives, so I can see that my feelings of being unique aren't particularly valid. People tend to be more alike than they are different, in my experience. I wrote a post on what it was like to attend 13 schools over a 12-year period, only to read accounts from an English-Canadian woman a couple of years older than me who had done something similar. I also discovered a fellow who lives a continent away who is similar to me in many other ways besides our schooling history. Taking inspiration from others writing is a way of relating in a more deep and connected way than social media could ever offer.</p>\n<p>Another ethical issue I and others have to deal with is the prevalence of AI writing tools and easily accessible they are. Things like grammar and spell checkers have been around for decades, but tools that can create an entire post from a mere prompt are new. I don't see myself letting some company's plagiarism machine create something that I would stick my name to. I don't have a problem having my spelling, grammar and punctuation checked by a computer because I'm used to that. Using a service that significantly changes my words, the tone and the structure just seems dishonest. There is a place for that in business, that being a cold and heartless environment. Blogging should have a soul. It should have a heart, and it should have an ethical code that the text you put under your byline is real and created by a human.</p>\n<p>On the honesty scale, I'd say I come in around 90% to 95% honest. Sometimes one has to stretch the truth a bit to protect the innocent or make a story worth telling. My style of writing is autobiographical. There are times when I just can't remember the exact order of events, where I was living or who I was married to (just kidding). I do the best I can. I aim to be entertaining and interesting, not to please a professional fact-checker. Of course, there are some things about which I always try to be scrupulously honest. When I write about sobriety and recovery, you can take it to the bank. If I convey a particularly funny story about something that happened while I was in the army, there may be a detail or two where I take a literary license. Most of military life is dull and boring, so if something sounds interesting, it's probably just in the way I'm writing it.</p>\n<p>I also tend to stick to just the facts when I write tech related posts. I want nothing more than to help someone find a real solution to a software issue. I'd feel horrible if I misled them about an app's suitability for a task, or if I wasn't diligent about pointing out a show stopping flaw. To the regular people in the world, a detailed explanation of menus, buttons, submenus and other user interface trivia is pure textual sleeping pills. For my fellow nerds and software geeks, it's vital information.</p>\n<p>At some point, my goal is to have more time to write more polished and detailed work, to spend more time fine-tuning what I put out there for folks to read. I want to work through more than one draft, like what I envision a real writer does, Meanwhile, I will continue to be a happy hack making stuff that's good enough to share even if it won't win any rewards.\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

There aren't enough bargains in the world to get me into a store with crazed bargain hunters today. I've seen the videos of shoppers being trampled so someone could save $50 on a big screen T. I plan to spend the day in the company ot my kids, grandkids and my Mom. We will hang out, telling stories and snacking. Our one trip away from home is a planned excursion for lunch to get some pho from the very appropriately named Vietnamese Restaurant. That's its name. The even funnier part is that all the people who work there are Korean.</p>\n<p><a href='https://parade.com/619946/solanahawkenson/black-friday-alternatives-10-positive-things-you-can-do-instead-of-shop/'>Black Friday Alternatives: Things To Do Instead of Shopping - Parade</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://do317.com/p/what-to-do-on-black-friday-instead-of-shopping'>What To Do On Black Friday Instead Of Shopping</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://www.itsmyfavoriteday.com/things-to-do-on-black-friday-besides-shopping/'>12 Things To Do On Black Friday Besides Shopping - It's My Favorite Day</a>\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/thanksgiving.webp\" alt=\"thanksgiving\" /></p>\n<p>This year's Thanksgiving has a special flavor. My son, who lives far away in Austin, Texas, is here for a visit. I still live in the house where he grew up, and he enjoys these nostalgic returns. After we got home from the airport yesterday, he went for a run. He came home to report that he'd passed the homes of old friends, the middle school he attended, and various spots where he's committed various teenage sins in his wayward youth.</p>\n<p>A little later, we went to the train station to pick up his daughter, our granddaughter, who was traveling to meet us from Virginia, where she attends school. We all went out for a sushi feast before coming home to hang out, telling stories, and making each other laugh.</p>\n<p>I get up early, and as I sit here writing, I have that wonderful protective parental feeling that reminds me of my younger days when I'd wait for the kids to get up so I could make them breakfast and start the day. Later on, we will all be traveling across town to attend the annual family gathering at the remnants of my uncle's farm, where I lived during my high school years. My daughter and two of our other grandchildren will be there, along with other relatives ranging in age from nearly 80 down to a six-year-old.</p>\n<p>Luckily, no one will talk politics in mixed company. If the coast is clear, the progressive wing of the family may console each other under our breaths, but no one will be wearing a MAGA hat or thanking the Good Lord for the election of Donald Trump. We will be asked to give reports on anyone who is missing. One of the best parts of these rare family conclaves is the chance to catch up on family news.</p>\n<p>Wonder Woman is sitting across from me, already beginning our holiday shopping. With five children and 13 grandchildren, she has a lot of gifts to buy. I send her ideas and give her feedback, but all the real work, including wrapping the gifts when they get here, falls to her. My Black Friday shopping is relegated to taking advantage of software sales, a relatively selfish pursuit that I thoroughly enjoy. I probably won't be getting many new apps this year because, quite frankly, I have so many already that it's hard to even find things on sale that I don't already have installed!</p>\n<p>I make a gratitude list every day as part of my journaling practice. It helps me stay in tune with how fortunate I am in so many ways. Since last Thanksgiving, a lot has happened that has given me new reasons to be thankful. After a long pause, I started blogging again, giving myself a creative outlet that is enjoyable and therapeutic. I've enjoyed a marked resurgence in my interest in technology and married that to my writing to produce content that's been viewed over 400,000 times by people all around the world.</p>\n<p>If you are reading this, know that I appreciate you. Thanks for being interested in my world. Feel free to leave a comment or to reach out on social media. Have a happy Thanksgiving, whether you live in the US or not. Let's make a better world in the year ahead.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

No one person has to cook it all. We do it potluck style, where everyone attending brings a dish or two. The only slightly out of the ordinary offering is the occasional bushel of oysters we may have on hand, since we all live relatively close to the Atlantic coast.</p>\n<p>Doing a little research, I discovered there are some definitely strange customs followed by different people in the US. Here are a few for you to peruse.</p>\n<p><a href='https://tucsonfoodie.com/2023/11/22/weird-thanksgiving-traditions/'>Weird Thanksgiving Traditions: Turduckens, Cap'n Crunch Stuffing & More</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://theculturetrip.com/north-america/usa/articles/these-are-the-11-weirdest-thanksgiving-traditions-ever'>These Are The Weirdest Thanksgiving Traditions Ever</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://www.immihelp.com/these-unusual-thanksgiving-traditions-are-common-in-the-us/'>These Unusual Thanksgiving Traditions Are Common in the U.S. - Immihelp</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/thanksgiving/comments/17h6svo/whats_your_unusual_thanksgiving_tradition/'>What’s your “unusual” Thanksgiving tradition? : r/thanksgiving</a>\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

You can use any type of input\ndevice, including your Mac&#39;s built-in microphone. MacWhisper can, if you\nchoose, replace the built-in dictation on your computer. Transcription\nis done on your device, not on a remote computer. The default output is\na .whisper file containing the original audio and the transcribed text,\nhowever it has numerous export choices:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>SRT and VTT subtitles</li>\n<li>CSV</li>\n<li>DOTE</li>\n<li>DOCX</li>\n<li>PDF</li>\n<li>Markdown</li>\n<li>HTML</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The transcription speed is remarkable, happening up to 30X over real\ntime using metal and GPU technology. Transcripts may be easily searched.\nFiller words (um, ah, etc.) are automatically removed. You can edit the\ntranscripts to correct spelling of names or other words.</p>\n\n<p>With the Pro version of the program, I get batch transcriptions of\nmultiple files. I can transcribe YouTube video and use my OpenAI key to\ntake advantage of Cloud Transcription and ChatGPT integration. I can\ntake advantage of translation services to convert text into other\nlanguages. It also adds a menu bar interface for global transcription\nand the ability to paste text into other apps.</p>\n\n<p>Students, non-profits and journalists always get 50% off the price by\ncontacting the developer. There is a free version of the app that lacks\nthe AI integration of the Pro version. It is available on <a\nhref=\"https://goodsnooze.gumroad.com/l/macwhisper\">Gumroad</a>.</p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=MacWhisper - Transcription Powerhouse' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

I get a good deal of comfort out of living in the same house for decades now. I was glad to keep the same job in the same building for 20 years before retiring. On the other hand, traveling and seeing new things is a special treat. My favorite part of my months-long honeymoon was sleeping in a different place every night. I like both things.</p>\n<p>In my job, most people are very unenthusiastic about having their computer updated, or god forbid, being issued a new one. When it comes to technology, the average person definitely prefers the familiar and comfortable over anything else. Not me. I'm always ready for new features, bug fixes, and extra security. Of course, since it's my profession, I'm more confident that I can fix any problems that pop up. Most of my career has been spent in education, where you would think people would be all about learning something new and expanding their horizons. You would be wrong if you thought that. Our ongoing controversy at work is around asking users to change the wireless network they use. That's it. Just select a different one from the list of what is available, type in your user name and password, and move on. Do I need to tell you how many meetings and conversations have already happened around this?</p>\n<p>Lots of decisions come down to something familiar vs. something new. Take going out to eat, for instance. Wonder Woman and I have a handful of tried-and-true locally owned restaurants which we frequent. When I see a new place featured in the newspaper, I immediately think of checking it out if it looks like something we'd fancy. We like international cuisine and we need gluten-free options. Yet, when it's the end of a long work day and we've decided that cooking is too much of a hassle, we almost always head to one of the places where we've been 100 times before. It's not called comfort food for nothing.</p>\n<p>I drive a 2005 Toyota Camry. It is a twenty-year-old hand-me-down from my mother, who literally drove it to church on Sundays. It has well over 200,000 miles. The paint is stained from being parked under an oak tree, and there are various scrapes and dents on every side of it. I've put exactly zero thought into getting a replacement for it. I haven't had a car payment since the Bush administration, and that thought horrifies me. I only drive it a couple of times a week to work and back anyway. Wonder Woman has a new Subaru Outback with all the bells and whistles, Apple Car Play, heated steering wheel, automatically adjusting mirrors and seats, a backup camera, the whole deal. I love to drive it and do so every chance I get.  It is indeed a balancing act.</p>\n<p>There are a few areas where I lean one way or another. I'm not much on rewatching movies or TV shows if I have already seen them, but I will re-read a book without hesitation. On my computer, I've used some of the same apps for many, many years, such as PathFinder (20 years), Evernote(15 years), and Launchbar(17 years) - all of which I ditched last year for replacements that I am now quite happy with. For other things, like email, I'm still using the same thing, the Gmail web interface that I have used since 2005.</p>\n<p>They say that without newness, memories don't get created, and life just sort of blends into a big blob. I believe that, so I do seek out new adventures. But I also relish in the comfort of the familiar. I expect most people are the same in that regard.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

I temper myself in public and on the Internet, mostly because my Mom reads my blogs and I care about offending her. But, when I am working on a troublesome computer or dealing with carrying my groceries across a rainy parking lot, swearing is in order. It's all kind of silly of course, deciding that one sound is OK but another sound is bad. I know a certain Kindergarten aged boy whose take home behavior chart recently had a big red X on it and a notation that he \"Said the F Word!!\" He probably won't do that again, not worth it I'm sure.</p>\n<p>As for movies, well society seems to have moved from not letting Lucy and Ricky Ricardo sleep in the same bed to an anything goes situation.

Its simple menu lets you designate watched folders\nwhere you keep images accessed as part of your workflow, for instance\nscreenshots and downloads. You can view thumbnails of the images, the\nsize is customizable and get info on them which includes name, size,\ndimensions, creation date, tag, caption and modification date. Tags and\ncaptions can be added from with Clotski. The information presented can\nbe customized, and other metadata can be added if you wish. You can open\nthe image with your default app or choose from other compatible apps\nfrom an &quot;open with&quot; menu. When viewing the list of images in a folder\nyou can choose a list, grid or gallery view, and you can choose the sort\norder based on date or file size in ascending or descending order.</p>\n\n<p>One feature that is especially helpful is Clotski&#39;s ability to\nautomatically download any images you copy to the clipboard into a\nfolder you designate. You can set your own naming convention, as well as\nchoosing to save them in either jpg or png formats.</p>\n\n<p>For keyboard warriors, Clotski can be summoned with a custom shortcut,\nand it can be navigated without the use of a mouse. For further\norganization, Clotski lets you create collections of photos along with\ntags and folders. Collections can be accessed from a drop-down menu\nwithin the program If desired, you can designate an automatic tag to be\napplied to images you add to newly collected images. You can use the\ntags just with Clotski, or you can sync them with the Finder.</p>\n\n<p>While working with images in Clotski, you can copy or drag them into\ndocuments on which you are working. Clotski does not have any native\nediting functionality,</p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Clotski - A Clever Tool for Your Image Management Workflow' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/burning-bridge.webp\" alt=\"burning-bridge\" /></p>\n<p>Some of the best advice I ever received was an admonition against burning bridges. An old co-worker told me that when I was getting ready to leave a job at which I was unhappy. The immature side of me wanted to leave in a blaze of glory, letting everyone know what I thought of them and the place that employed them. Somehow I'd convinced myself that my opinion was important and that all those people needed my approval to be happy - none of which was actually true. You may have seen someone do exactly what I contemplated. It's always icky and transparent and never looks good.</p>\n<p>Sometimes people start burning their bridges when they are getting ready to leave a group as a way of self-protection. They don't want the separation to hurt so they begin to withdraw and cut off relationships. That's understandable. But I try to avoid doing it as best I can.  Sometimes in our lives a certain group dynamic only exists for a short while under a certain set of circumstances that can never be recaptured - political campaigns, social movements, even some educational opportunities are like that. Just because the magic of the moment is gone doesn't mean that the people involved in it are no longer valuable, not because of what they can do for you, but just because people and relationships have an intangible worth that we honor when we continue to respect them.</p>\n<p>In the current political environment in the US, I am very much of the mind to avoid people who like and support the president-elect. Their values and mine are obviously tremendously different. At a fundamental level, I just don't understand what makes them tick, nor do I have a desire to. But, I'm not seeking out every conservative I know to let them know that Lou Plummer thinks they are a bad person. There are ways to avoid people without purposefully alienating them. This in no way means that I'll silently nod my head when someone begins to spout off about how wonderful DT is, it just means that I don't feel the need to tell anyone off preemptively.</p>\n<p>When someone decides that ending a relationship with me on a negative note is the thing to do, it makes me wonder what they hope to gain. It doesn't happen very often, and usually when it does, it's part of a mass casualty event when a disgruntled co-worker exits, but occasionally it's personal. It reeks of immaturity and poor judgement. I do the best I can not to take it personally. Some people are just built that way, I suppose. In reality, telling someone off, getting the last word, and making a dramatic exit only kind of feel good and only in the moment. That action is usually followed by a big let down and moments of self-doubt.</p>\n<p>It's like my Mama (and probably yours too) used to say. If you don't have anything good to say, don't say anything. It’s not trite. It's true in most contexts. Exceptions can be made for calling out injustice and bigotry. <BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

Twitter is having it's second mass exodus. The first happened when Elon Musk purchased the network in 2022. The most recent is a result of the 2024 US election. The primary beneficiary appears to be Bluesky. Mark Zuckerberg is being mocked for rapidly making changes to Meta's Threads to copy the things people like about other networks. Even Instagram is now allowing users to reset the algorithm so they can see more from people they follow and less of what Meta wants them to see.</p>\n<p>Over the years there have been many social networks come and go. They promise to be the next big thing  but they end up falling to the wayside when they end up not being able to compete with the behemoths. Let's hope the underdogs make it this time.

Then I retired and was at a loss. I read a lot of books and watched a bunch of movies, but it wasn't what I'd call really fun. Instead, it felt like I was just doing things to occupy my time. Eventually, I just went back to work. That was a pretty good solution, but not a perfect one. I still think about not having to work a lot, but I think the next time I get that opportunity, it will be different.</p>\n<p>My fantasy retirement includes plenty of time for writing. Over the past year, I have made blogging a priority by default. It's something I enjoy. I do it every day, and I can just imagine having the time to fully develop ideas, do research, and polish my posts instead of the rush jobs I'm knocking out now. I'd like to have a nice office space at home with decent speakers to play music on, a really comfortable office chair with all my tried-and-true computer essentials right there at my fingertips. I don't currently use my office space because it's not where Wonder Woman hangs out. When we are at home together, we like to be together.</p>\n<p>I'm so conscious of my limited free time right now that I don't like to use any of it to do anything except exactly what I want to do, with a few limits. I imagine myself with more time, being more willing to get a walking routine established with just the right mix of music playlists and downloaded podcasts like I did before my mobility was limited by knee surgery. I would not be forced into early pre-dawn walks like I am now.</p>\n<p>Since I'm a couple of years older than Wonder Woman, part of my fantasy retirement will be spent at home while she is still working. I will be able to use my time to do some of the chores, like grocery shopping, that we now do together on the weekends. I'm not going too far out on a limb by claiming that I will be Molly Maid or anything because that ain't happening. The cleaning and lawn services we've had over the past few years have been among the best investments we've ever made, and I am way too used to them to think about moving backward and taking that stuff back over myself.</p>\n<p>A few years ago, I looked into volunteering at a few places using the skill set I have in technology. I didn't find anything that was a good fit around my work hours, but I'd be willing to look into that once more while having a much more flexible schedule. We have one of the best military history museums in the world in my hometown, but it's mostly staffed by retired guys from the 82nd Airborne and Special Forces. My half-communist ass would probably not fit in well there, although you never know. I have some retired military friends who are just as radical as I imagine myself to be.</p>\n<p>The primary benefit of not having to go to work is that I'll no longer have to do customer relations. I'm not the biggest people person. Although I don't have any problems with getting along with folks at work 99% of the time, that remaining 1% is a giant PIA that sucks the joy out of too many days. When I never have to crawl under another desk to plug something in for another adult, I will truly be a happy man.</p>\n<p>For the time being, however, I'm going to keep punching the clock and just enjoy knowing that, if push comes to shove, I can make my way towards the exit. I'll enjoy the 99% of the job that isn't aggravating and be extra grateful that I get to ride back and forth (and eat lunch!) with the love of my life.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

They are  the big three\nin Microsoft Office, the menu bar manager, Bartender and the window\nmanager, Magnet.</p>\n\n<p>The vendor with the most apps on the list is surprisingly, Microsoft\nwith five.</p>\n\n<p>For it&#39; market share to be as small as it, Firefox must have a higher\nproportion of Mac users employing it than PC users.</p>\n\n<p>I would wager that VLC&#39;s popularity is due to its longevity and because\nof enterprise deployments. I know I have been putting it on images in\nthe educational space for as long as I can remember. IINA seems more\npopular with more knowledgeable users,</p>\n\n<p>Despite all the predictions made about Bartender&#39;s future after the\nbotched handling of its sale, it is the most downloaded paid app in the\necosystem after Microsoft Office.</p>\n\n<p>I have never been a big user of window management tools, and I had no\nidea Magnet was as popular as it is. It has 165,000 reviews in the App\nStore and a 4.9 rating.</p>\n\n<p>I find it interesting that the top 25 apps did not include a single\nnotes app, automation tool or clipboard manager. The only messaging app\nis Microsoft Teams, and I hesitate to say that is its primary function.</p>\n\n<p>The presence of the six-year-old Android File Transfer app is\nmind-blowing. I suspect this indicates that the download figures are\nworldwide and include countries where Androids have huge market share.</p>\n\n<p>The high ranking of App Cleaner is good for two reasons - it\ndemonstrates that an app doesn&#39;t have to be updated constantly to be\nuseful (last update was 2023-07-05). It also shows that lots of people\nbelieve in doing more than just dragging unwanted apps to the trash.</p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=The Top 25 Most Downloaded Mac Apps' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

I don't know how many times I read it fro cover to cover, but it was a lot. The things we curious types could read about back in the 70s were much more exciting than what books kids can get a hold of today. Aside from Guinness we had Ripley's Believe It or Not and multiple books on things like The Bermuda Triangle, Bigfoot and more.

In World War Two, Japanese soldiers committed mass suicide in battle after battle rather than surrendering or being beaten.  I am reminded of a scene from the Will Ferrell comedy, <em>Talladega Nights</em>, after Ricky Bobby's sons brag of throwing their grandfather's war medals over a bridge and disrespecting a teacher, their dad exclaims \"My boys are winners and winners get to do whatever they want.\" It's obvious that a lot of people share that sentiment.</p>\n<p>Athletic contests by design have a winner and a loser at the end of the competition, but who is going to call Aaron Judge of the NY Yankees, a man whose salary is twice that of the entire Detroit Tigers, a loser?  Are the athletes who go to the Olympic games and don't win a medal losers? Maybe they use that definition on their own minds as motivation, I don't know. I've only been around a couple of Olympians and I didn't ask them. I just know that from my own athletic career, I felt like a winner every time I gave the competition everything I had. What more could I do?</p>\n<p>I've never been as opposed to anything in my life as I was against the Us war with Iraq. I opposed it with everything I had. When Obama, who unlike other prominent Democrats, had never supported the war, was elected, I felt like the antiwar movement had won. So did a lot of other folks. Most coalitions closed up shop as we waited for the troops to come home. Only it took years for the last soldier to leave Iraq (2011). When Obama left office in 2017, there were still American soldiers in Afghanistan for reasons no one could really explain.</p>\n<p>There are people who turn just about everything into a competition to satisfy some need they have to be better than other people. I've known too many dentists and ad execs who, in their minds, turn into Tour de France riders on a Saturday morning bicycle ride at the club ride. Putting other people in danger and disrupting the flow of the entire undertaking is entirely acceptable in their minds if they can beat a bunch of school teachers and retirees to the next stop sign. Even on something as neutral as the Appalachian Trail, there were those people who bragged at camp sites about how many miles they'd covered and how fast they'd hiked. No one cared.</p>\n<p>It's funny how these competitive types never try to win the competition on the job to close the most tickets or help the most customers. I wonder why.</p>\n<p>After the recent election, a lot of people feel like they are on the winning side, but I have news for them. Unless they are in the 1%, they are going to come out of the next four years on the losing end. The educational system is going to suffer, and that hurts everyone.  Unmitigated climate change will accelerate, and that hurts everyone. Pollution will increase. Government services will be deprecated. We will all live in a less functional country. All of that Trump-style winning is going to help one fat guy with a bad combover and too much makeup.</p>\n<p>Winners are happy people. Winners are those amongst us who live in peace. They don't have the biggest houses or the nicest cars. What they have is appreciation for what they've got and an absence of longing for what they don't. They enjoy what they enjoy without a need to beat someone else. I like winners like that.\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

An app has to be super useful and be\nsomething I use frequently to remain visible at all times. The latest\naddition by Sindre Sorhus, Supercharge is an instant add. It has a great\nmany uses and has replaced other utilities that have narrower focus.\nMore tools are being added regularly, so if you have this app, make sure\nto install updates as soon as they are released to get new features. I\nwon&#39;t cover them all, just the ones I use personally.</p>\n\n<h2>From the Menu Bar</h2>\n\n<p>The menu bar icon presents the following option in a drop-down:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Hide all windows</li>\n<li>Show Desktop</li>\n<li>Quit All Apps</li>\n<li>Hide My Email (opens this buried item in System Settings)</li>\n<li>Private Relay opens this buried item in System Settings)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Tweaks</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Unminimize windows when app becomes active</li>\n<li>Dim icons of hidden apps in the dock</li>\n<li>Create new text file with Option+N</li>\n<li>Open new files after naming</li>\n<li>Auto-adjust column widths in Finder</li>\n<li>Quit an app when closing its last Window (I don't usually like to mimic Micro$oft behavior, but I like this feature)</li>\n<li>When clicking on an active icon in the dock, hide app</li>\n<li>Add to Finder's context menu<ul>\n<li>Copy path</li>\n<li>Copy file name</li>\n<li>Image dimensions</li>\n<li>Make symlink</li>\n<li>Move to...</li>\n<li>Copy to...</li>\n<li>Open in Terminal (for folders)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p></li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p>The ability to make those modifications in the Finder makes it much more\npowerful.</p>\n\n<h2>Shortcuts</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Toggle desktop widgets</li>\n<li>Open Passwords from menu bar</li>\n<li>Hide all windows</li>\n<li>Quit all apps (except menu bar apps)</li>\n<li>Show desktop</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I was using the beta feature to close visible notifications which\ndefinitely had a beta feel to it, until I discovered that Better Touch\nTool&#39;s implementation of this feature closes not just visible\nnotifications, but all existing ones. I&#39;m sure Sindre will get this\nworking similarly in future releases.</p>\n\n<h2>Tools</h2>\n\n<p>I work on an MBA at home and an iMac for work. For apps that don&#39;t have\niCloud sync, using the export and import settings tool has been\nextremely useful and has saved me a ton of time. It&#39;s also useful when I\nwant to experiment with how an app is set up, allowing me to revert\nsettings if I don&#39;t like what I get after changing things around.</p>\n\n<p>You can get a fully functional copy of the app <a\nhref=\"https://sindresorhus.com/supercharge\">here</a>. The only\nlimitation is a reminder to buy the app every 12 hours, and no automatic\nupdates. All data and settings carry over if you buy it.</p>\n\n<p>I suggest you just go ahead and buy the app. If there was ever an\nInstabuy, this is it.</p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Using Supercharge' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/family-1.webp\" alt=\"Family\" /></p>\n<p>This might be rough for some. Not everyone had a happy childhood. Mine certainly had its rough spots, but for the most part, we had a lot of opportunities for pure joy too. So, in no particular order, here is a hit parade from the 70s.</p>\n<p><strong>Music</strong> - My mom and stepfather had a record player that stayed busy. I grew up listening to music that I still play today. We had all the Beatles albums. James Taylor got a lot of airtime. Especially for us kids, we got to listen to Pete Seeger sing <em>Little Boxes</em> and <em>Abi-Yoyo</em>. I even remember my stepfather playing a particular Arlo Guthrie record with <em>Alice's Restaurant</em>. My own dad was partial to Neil Diamond, so I get feelings for him whenever I hear one of the familiar songs.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong> - My mom didn't always cook breakfast, but more often than not, we didn't have to resort to cereal. Being in the South meant that bacon, eggs, and grits were a staple, although she had an actual waffle iron, so we got that sometimes. Pancakes and oatmeal were also on offer. When we did get cereal, there was always a controversy over whose turn it was to get the prize in the bottom of the box. I wasn't really fond of the \"eat everything on your plate\" rule that my stepfather imposed because Mom insisted on regularly serving English peas, which I despise to this day. I did learn how to enjoy asparagus though.</p>\n<p><strong>Travel</strong> - We weren't that well off, but we managed to have plenty of opportunities to visit parks and beaches when we happened to be living in the eastern part of the state. We moved a lot. When I grew up, I took my kids to some of the same places I'd been able to go to as a kid. One problem with travel was the size of the cars my parents had. Imagine five people in a Ford Pinto on a late-night trip up Interstate 95 from central NC to Washington, DC. That one was partially a business trip. My stepfather, a journalist, got to attend a press conference with other NC reporters to grill President Ford.</p>\n<p><strong>Holidays</strong> - Despite the lack of funds, we were never disappointed at Christmas. We got all the regular stuff kids get: bikes that lasted for years, baseball gloves, and always books about whatever we happened to be interested in at the time. We usually traveled to see family too. To my mother's everlasting credit, even though she and my dad got divorced around the time I started school, she has stayed in contact with his family to this very day. My dad lived out of state, but we still got to see our grandparents, our aunt, and our uncles.</p>\n<p><strong>Freedom</strong> - In the time before cell phones and excessive protectiveness, we had the license to roam. I was a hustler as a kid, always on the lookout to make a few bucks, and I rode my bike far and wide looking for soda bottles to sell back to the store. I walked the roads looking for aluminum cans. My mom willingly took me to the salvage yard to cash those in. We always had permission to go to the library when we lived someplace where it was close enough to get to. Some summers I practically lived there. Lots of times we lived in apartments with pools, and when we didn’t, we joined a co-op pool, which I didn't realize until I was an adult was whites only. I was born the year the civil rights act was signed, but there were still vestiges of segregation around if you looked.</p>\n<p><strong>TV and Movies</strong> - We had the same 19-inch TV my entire childhood. In the afternoons, we'd watch black and white re-runs of <em>The Beverly Hillbillies, The Andy Griffith Show, and Gomer Pyle.</em> Some of our favorite nighttime shows were <em>Happy Days</em> and * Laverne and Shirley.* One little town we lived in had a main street movie theater with one-dollar tickets. We could just about see the place from our house, and we got to go there whenever anything appropriate was playing. We still make fun of my sister for leaving <em>Pippi Longstocking</em> early because she got scared.</p>\n<p>What was best about all of that was that it took place in an environment of my mother's love and commitment to give us the best childhood she could. She 100% succeeded, and I am so very grateful to this day.\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

There&#39;s not much you can throw at it that it\ncan&#39;t handle, including old files from StuffIt and DiskDoubler. It can\neven extract files from some Windows .exe installers. The problem with\nThe UnArchiver is that it does decompression only. If you want to make\nyour own archives, you need another program. Natively, macOS can create\nZIP and DMG files but that&#39;s it.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://macitbetter.com/\">BetterZip 5 from macitbetter i</a>s a\nmuch more full-featured app, although it isn&#39;t free. It&#39;s $24.95 for use\non up to five Macs for personal users. It is also available on Setapp.\nBetter Zip has some pretty cool superpowers:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Quicklook extension for viewing files inside archives without opening them</li>\n<li>Edit archived files in an external application, and BetterZip can save the changes back and update your archive.</li>\n<li>Open and extract winmail.dat files.</li>\n<li>Open, extract, and modify ePub files.</li>\n<li>Extract images and sounds from PDFs</li>\n<li>AES-256 Encryption, password manager, password generator</li>\n<li>Finder Integration and share menu</li>\n<li>Filtering - only extract certain files from archives</li>\n<li>Integration with Alfred and Hazel</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Keka is a perennial favorite of many Mac users. It has a free version on\n<a href=\"https://www.keka.io/en/\">the developer&#39;s website</a>and a $5\nversion on the <a\nhref=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/keka/id470158793?mt=12\">Mac App\nStore.</a> Keka has compression and decompression tools. Keka can divide\nlarge files into multiple parts that will automatically reassemble after\ndecompression. You gain the ability to use 256-bit encryption. You can\nalso take advantage of a drag and drop interface into the Keka main\nwindow, or by simply dropping files onto the Keka icon in the dock.</p>\n\n<p>For those who want scripting and a CLI as well as a GUI, <a\nhref=\"https://peazip.github.io/\">Peazip</a> is probably the best bet. A\nfree app, it also has the widest array of security features.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Offers two-factor authentication</li>\n<li>Opens 200 types of compressed files in the GUI</li>\n<li>Multiple file management features: convert archives, search in archives, bookmarks, tabbed browsing,</li>\n<li>Portable - can be run from a USB or other external drive</li>\n<li>Open Source</li>\n<li>Cross platform (Linus, macOS Windows)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Some Finder alternatives offer compression and decompression, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://commander-one.com/\">Commander One</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/pathfinder-by-cocoatech\">PathFinder</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/qspace\">Qspace</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Mac Compression Utilities' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

When Attorney General William Barr and Milley explained that the law didn't allow that, Trump responded, “Well, shoot them in the leg – or maybe the foot. But be hard on them!.”</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.vox.com/2021/4/25/22367019/gop-laws-oklahoma-iowa-florida-floyd-blm-protests-police'>Many states havepassed laws that provide immunity</a> to drivers who kill protesters with their cars. Think about it. Republicans, and all these bills were passed by GOP-controlled legislatures, are essentially invoking the death penalty for the crime of blocking traffic. Following the alt-right/Nazi rally in Charlottesville, VA in 2017, <a href='https://www.npr.org/2019/06/28/736915323/neo-nazi-who-killed-charlottesville-protester-is-sentenced-to-life-in-prison'>Heather Heyer was killed by a self-professed Nazi</a> who drove his car into a crowd of protesters. If he'd done that in modern-day Iowa or Oklahoma, he would be free today instead of doing life in prison.</p>\n<p>When Richard Nixon ran for president, he did so on a law and order platform. Under his watch, the Ohio National Guard opened fire on unarmed students protesting the Vietnam War and the invasion of Cambodia at <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_State_shootings'>Kent State University</a>. Four were killed. Nine more were shot but survived. The Nixon administration blamed the students for the shootings. None of the National Guardsmen were ever convicted of any criminal charges.</p>\n<p>Less than two years later, Irish Catholics marching for civil rights in Derry, Northern Ireland, were fired on by paratroopers from the British Army. It was January 30, 1972, a day known as <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloody_Sunday_%281972%29%3E'>Bloody Sunday</a>. Fourteen unarmed men were killed. Twelve more were shot but survived. Many outright lies were presented by the British government justifying the killings. It took decades before British Prime Minister David Cameron finally absolved those killed of any guilt. By then, it was too late. Thirty years of violence between the IRA, loyalist paramilitary groups, and the British Army resulted in over 3,000 deaths.</p>\n<p>If the Trump administration resorts to militarized responses to the legitimate grievances of the American people, we are going to have a lot of new articles on Wikipedia about infamous incidents with lists of the names of those killed by a government that will blame the innocent and the unarmed for their own deaths.\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/ago_downloaded.webp\" alt=\"Bible Belt\" /></p>\n<p>For a good part of my life, I tried to be religious and failed miserably. During my formative years, church was a social connection as well as a place for religious instruction. During elementary school, my Mom was married to a non-believer, so she didn't attend church, but my siblings and I went with a neighbor to a Southern Baptist church on the outskirts near the prison. My brother and I were active in the boys’ youth group, called RAs for Royal Adventurers. In the summer, we went to VBS (Vacation Bible School).</p>\n<p>In high school, I lived with my aunt and uncle. They went to a Presbyterian Church, one of many in the area, reflecting the Scottish heritage in the part of North Carolina where we lived. One of my favorite parts of each week was the Sunday evening Youth Fellowship meetings. It was the one place where kids from the different high schools in the area hung out together. We had a church league softball team that was a lot of fun. Our yearly beach trip was something I looked forward to immensely. I got a lot of love there in spite of getting caught smoking weed by the youth minister. I wasn't a well-behaved kid, but I was still welcome.</p>\n<p>As an adult, I have attended Baptist, Presbyterian, and Seventh-day Adventist churches. I've been baptized at least twice. I may have also been baptized as a baby since during the brief time my parents were married to each other, they attended the Methodist church, which practices infant baptism. All three of my children attended private, church-affiliated schools for part of their K-12 lives.</p>\n<p>Both my sister and my father are ordained ministers in the United Methodist Church. It was a second career for both of them. In retirement, Dad no longer worships at a Methodist church because it has grown too liberal for him. My mother has done medical missionary work in Rwanda. She is a member of an Anglican church that is affiliated with the Rwandan version of that denomination. She was a member of an Episcopalian church for a long time, but when her congregation split after the ordination of Gene Robinson, an openly gay bishop, she went with her husband and the other conservatives to form a new congregation. My sister has many of the same political beliefs that I hold, and she is one of the few people I feel comfortable talking to when it comes to issues of faith.</p>\n<p>Despite all that churching, I ended up a non-believer. I tried as hard as I knew how to find a connection with a supernatural God, but I never felt anything, not ever. As a recovering alcoholic from the 12-Step tradition, which relies heavily on the concept of a \"higher power,\" I had to do considerable mental gymnastics to finally get sober. I finally resolved to use my AA group as a power greater than myself. Collectively, that is 100% true, and it was only after I stopped fighting against what I felt was an inappropriate religious influence that I was able to stop drinking for good, or at least for the last 16 years.</p>\n<p>Aside from the lack of an emotional connection with religion, my other reasons for the position I hold are much the same as many other non-believers. I can't reconcile things like the Holocaust and childhood leukemia with a loving and caring God. The historical reality of how the Bible became canon is more than a little sus to me as well. I really like quite a few parts of it anyway, especially The Sermon on the Mount, which is as good an outlook on a righteous life as I have seen anywhere. I am also disgusted to the very core of who I am as a person with right-wing-influenced Christianity. People who talk Jesus out of one side of their mouth and cut nutrition programs for the poor out of the other side are contemptible, and I want as little to do with them as possible. When I think of the average white conservative Christian, I think of the ways they advocate for things like discrimination against LGBT people, their support for the death penalty, and their attempts to force their beliefs into the political fabric of a country that was founded on religious freedom. I like Christians like Jimmy Carter and Martin Luther King, Jr. I do not like Christians like James Dobson and Tony Perkins. I think they are evil people.\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

Various apps like <a\nhref=\"https://obsidian.md/\">Obsidian</a> and <a\nhref=\"https://bear.app/\">Bear</a> use Markdown by default. There is a\nwhole ecosystem of tools around the easy-to-use language where you use\nvarious keyboard elements to create styles that can be interpreted by\nbrowsers and other apps. Markdown lets you add:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Bold</li>\n<li>Italic</li>\n<li>Quotes</li>\n<li>Lists (numbered, bullets, and checklists)</li>\n<li>Links (to web pages and images)</li>\n<li>Code blocks</li>\n<li>Headers</li>\n<li>Tables</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are different flavors of Markdown, but the most commonly used one\nis referred to as GitHub-flavored Markdown. As a blogger, I prefer to\nwrite in Markdown to format my posts for the web. The free app, <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/MarkEdit-app/MarkEdit\">MarkEdit</a> uses 100%\npure GitHub Markdown. Out of the box. The interface is pretty bare\nbones, but you can customize the toolbar to use the various tools on\nselected text. MarkEdit permits the insertion of multiple carats, so you\ncan highlight disconnected blocks of text. MarkEdit is intended to be a\nminimalist writing tool. It has a good feature set. There isn&#39;t any\nbloat. There are plenty of other editors that have preview, different\nflavors of Markdown and more.

Why or why not?\"</p>\n<p>By nature, I am neither a pessimist nor an optimist. I do the best I can to live in the moment. The future will take care of itself, I figure. I do have my moments where I dare to contemplate what's going to happen. I don't always have a rosy view. Like a lot of people, the recent presidential election shook me to my core. The realization of a  lot of my worst fears is already in motion as our new government takes shape. From a purely personal perspective, here in old white guy land, things are just grand. The future of Lou is pretty rosy, but I will be damned before I let that selfish perspective be the lens through which I view the world.</p>\n<p>As bad as things look, there is one overriding truth. Throughout the history of mankind, things have always gotten better. Sometimes the pace has been excruciatingly slow. At other times, progress has been made at breathtaking speed. I look at things like HIV research. We've gone from an epidemic illness being a death sentence to it becoming just another treatable illness in one generation. We went from the first airplane to landing on the moon in a single lifetime. Mankind is badass like that.</p>\n<p>When I talk to friends having a rough time, I like to remind them that every bad thing that has ever happened to them in the whole entire life hasn't killed them. Whatever they happen to be going through at the moment, whether it be a lost job, a divorce, or something else, isn't likely to kill them either. Sometimes in life, you lose battle after battle only to win the war. During the civil rights movement, the people of Birmingham had police dogs turned on them and were sprayed with fire hoses as police chief Bull Connor dealt violently with nonviolent protesters. John Lewis had his skull fractured for marching across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama. The very next year, the Civil Rights Act was passed. Bull Connor lost, and John Lewis won.</p>\n<p>Life is a series of peaks and valleys. When we are down in the valley like we are right now, it's hard to remember what the mountain tops were like. It's a lot easier to be pessimistic than it is to be positive. People of faith have heaven to look forward to, but secular people just have their one wild and precious life. I'll not let anyone take away the things in this life that give it meaning. I will continue to be a loud and proud progressive. I will hold on to the values I have until I find a better alternative. There are plenty of people like me. The conservatives have won two majorities over a period of 32 years. Their current hold on power is temporary, and unless we move into a total dictatorship, and I realize there is a chance of that, we will have weapons of democracy to use.</p>\n<p>The challenges we face are real. Climate change, competition for resources, rising authoritarianism, oppression of vulnerable minorities - all of these things are real. We will experience setbacks in combating them, but we will win in the end. We always do.\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

There are some apps that let you increase\nthat number, but not by much. At most, you&#39;ll have a couple of days work\nto refer back to. The app, <a\nhref=\"https://recentsapp.com/\">Recents</a>, will trace you work back by\nmonths in some cases.</p>\n\n<p>Recents breaks your workflow down on a per-app basis and provides the\nmost recently used documents for each one, even if the app itself\ndoesn&#39;t have a recent files menu. For example, I use Rapidmg to open\ndisk images. The program normally opens the disk image, moves the\ncontents to my Applications folder, and then dismounts and closes\nwithout any intervention from me. There is no menu. Using Recents, I can\nsee a list of the last 15 DMGs I&#39;ve opened, and reopen them at will.</p>\n\n<p>Recents works with a wide variety of apps and file types. In the\nadmittedly confusing file structure we use at work, I often can&#39;t\nremember the exact path of saved documents, but I know the app I created\nit with. Using Recents, I can easily find and open what I am looking for\nin a centralized location. Some of the apps with which I use Recents\nare:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Microsoft Office</li>\n<li>Console</li>\n<li>Preview</li>\n<li>PDF Expert</li>\n<li>VLC</li>\n<li>Obsidian (opens vaults, not documents)</li>\n<li>Motrix</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The app has a light and dark mode and can be set to mimic your system\npreferences. Recents can be access three ways:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>From the dock</li>\n<li>From the menu bar</li>\n<li>Hidden and summoned from a hot key</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Recents can be downloaded from <a href=\"https://recentsapp.com/\">the\ndevelopers website</a>.

It wasn't a big deal to me. At the time, all I wanted were allies against the Bush administration'd policies and Aiden was just such a person. That was almost 20 years ago. We are still friends on Facebook to this day, although I have not see him for years. I didn't get into activism until I was nearly 40 and I had no idea how things work on the left. We get criticized often for going off topic. People talk about Palestine at the wrong time or they bring up Trans rights in the wrong places. I here to tell you, Trans rights are human rights and there isn't a wrong time to be an advocate for human rights, especially these days. The Republicans can't get us cheaper eggs so they are keeping their hate filled agenda going by tapping into the anti-trans sentiment they have ginned up.</p>\n<p>Even if you've never knowingly met a trans man or woman, you still have room in your life to be an ally and an advocate. Don't let people denigrate them in your presence and let others know how you feel about respecting human rights - all human rights. Make a donation to the Trevor project.

Just about anything can be funny if you frame it the right way. It sometimes shocks people who don't know me that well, but anyone who has to suffer through working with me gets used to it rather quickly. I lean towards dry and acerbic humor because that's pretty much the way I perceive the world. There are an awful lot of absurd things about being alive, and pointing them out to people gives me purpose. I can't stand it when there is an obvious joke waiting to be made and yet no one will say anything because \"inappropriate.\" No! Someone needs to get that laugh. It might as well be me.</p>\n<p>I went through a stage when I downloaded routines of some of the most famous comics who have ever lived to listen to when I was spending a lot of time in my car for work. Being funny on demand didn't seem easy, but it didn't seem that hard either. I thought about writing some jokes and going to an open mic night at a comedy club, but I never followed through. For one thing, me and bars don't mix well, and I also might have been a little bit chicken. It was still fun listening to Richard Pryor, Lenny Bruce, Bill Hicks and even Bill Cosby. This was before he went to prison for being a predator.</p>\n<p>I think Richard Pryor is probably the funniest human who ever lived. His humor is timeless because it's about the human condition. A lot of comedians do topical comedy, which is funny at the moment, but it doesn't age well. My daughter thought me and her mother were so weird because we went on and on about how funny the show <em>In Living Color</em> was. She finally found it on DVD and watched a few episodes. It was full of jokes about Barbara Bush and Mike Tyson and other people who just weren't part of her world. She was very disappointed and hasn't asked me for entertainment options in a very long time.</p>\n<p>I try not to be think-skinned when listening to stand-up. I'm more than willing to grant artistic license to a performer, but there are still some lines that don't need to be crossed. I don't like anti-trans humor. If you were to substitute some other marginalized group for tans folks into some of those jokes, people would look at you like you were wearing a Klan robe. I get that not everyone  \"gets\" the struggle of that community, but making jokes at their expense is getting old. Even otherwise perceptive people like Dave Chappelle and Ricky Gervais fall into the not-funny category when it comes to that brand of humor.</p>\n<p>I love using humor as a weapon when I don't have anything else to offer. Any time someone tries to defend the indefensible to me, I laugh at them. You want to defend Trump? You're funny because he's a clown, and you're one too if you're defending him. Not only that, but you want to tell me why the death penalty or cutting school lunch programs are good ideas? I'm going to laugh right in your face. How can you seriously feel that way and call yourself a human being?  Maybe that's disrespectful. Ok, it is disrespectful, but I don't really care. Laughing at you is better than fighting with you, which I don't care to do.</p>\n<p>Feel free to send me jokes.\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

Unless you can&#39;t. Then you\nhave a problem. Or, maybe you are experimenting with <a\nhref=\"https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/open-core-legacy-patcher\">Open\nCore Legacy Patcher</a> to install a later version of macOS on a device\nthat doesn&#39;t officially support it. In that case, you are going to need\na copy of an OS, preferably bootable, and some sort of media to copy\nthat OS installation onto. You can do the installation through other\nmethods, like target disk mode or various imaging applications too, but\nthey take some know how. The other thing you can use these files for is\nwhen experimenting with virtual machines in something like Virtual Box,\nUTM or VMWare Fusion.</p>\n\n<h2>Mist</h2>\n\n<p>To get a copy of the firmware and OS you need, I know of no easier\nmethod than using <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/ninxsoft/Mist?tab=readme-ov-file\">Mist</a>, a\nfree app available on GitHub. With Mist, you can get everything from the\nlatest beta, all the way back to Mac OS X 7.5.

In fact, coming from a 12-Step recovery tradition, I have no real opinion on drinking as an institution, but I've never looked down my nose at anyone who enjoys a cold beer, a glass of win or a mixed drink. I don't look down my nose at people who have a problem with booze either. Nobody volunteers to become an alcoholic. Alcohol just has a way of taking over the lives of a certain percentage of the population, usually ones who have family members with the same issue. There are certain genetic markers for addiction and whether it's an illness isn't really debatable anymore except by science denying morons - so about half of America.LOL.Sob.</p>\n<p>I digress. My point is, if you have decided not to drink for a night or for the rest of your life, whatever, here are a few things I have learned. Number one - it's less of a big deal to other people than you think it is. When people who like to drink are kinda sorta thinking about stopping, they almost always cite the social pressure to drink as a reason why they can't. That's their inner little drunk devil talking to them. Nobody cares! They aren't thinking about you as much as you think they are.</p>\n<p>When you are at a party or a family holiday celebration, get a non-alcoholic drink and hold on to that sucker for dear life. DO NOT PUT IT DOWN! If you're trying to camouflage your sobriety, put a twist and a swizzle stick in you club soda. Just don't let go of it. I've had a couple of occasions where I've failed to obey this rule and ended up with a horrifying mouth full my step-father's gin and my sister's wine. Not cool. I didn't relapse or anything, but it's not a good feeling. Once my sister-in-law spilled a glass of wine on me and I had  two-hour drive home. I used Vick's Medicated Rub in my nostrils to kill the smell just like people at the morgue do to cover up the smell of decaying flesh.</p>\n<p>You can also plan on arriving late and leaving early to any parties when you are trying to live that sober life. Drinking mocktails or alcohol free beer is an option for some but personally I never wanted the romance of booze without the booze. If you get a craving for alcohol, eating sweets is a well known way to make the craving subside. Trust me.</p>\n<p>If you've decided you do have a problem and you want to quit for good, and brothers and sisters, I'm here to tell you that for real problem drinkers, cutting back is not the answer. Abstinence is. Sorry, them's the facts. Anyway, if you want to quit, you can. You've never met anyone in your life who loves to drink as much as me and I haven't had one in about 16 years because of reasons. Lots of reasons.</p>\n<p>My inbox is always open.</p>\n<p><a href='https://rethinkingdrinking.niaaa.nih.gov/tools/worksheets-more/handling-urges-drink'>How to Stop Alcohol Cravings - Handling the Urges to Drink - Rethinking Drinking | NIAAA</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://www.hazeldenbettyford.org/articles/how-to-stop-drinking'>How to Stop Drinking Alcohol | Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/alcohol-use-disorder/how-to-stop-drinking'>How to Stop Drinking Alcohol, According to Experts - GoodRx</a>\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

Panicked, he sent a text message to almost everyone in the family asking for help. At this point, that means my siblings and his. We are a close family and several of us sprang into action. His brother-in-law lives a couple of miles away and was the first to arrive. My aunt, a nurse with more than 40 years experience was there within the hour. They got him to the doctor and then the hospital where the doctors are running tests to rule out a stroke. His thinking seems to have cleared up since he sent the original text but he still couldn't figure out how to set an alarm on his phone. That kind of thing is starting to happen with more frequency.</p>\n<p>Dad is the sole care-giver for my step-mother who has Alzheimers. She still know who he is, although most of the rest of us are becoming strangers to her. She still hugs me and tells me she loves me, but when she was recently asked by a doctor how many children my Dad has (four), she was unable to answer. Her and Dad were in a car accident last month and the next day she didn't understand why she felt so sore, unable to remember what happened. Even though he walks with a cane or a walker, Dad still cooks for her and takes her on the daily drive she insists on going on.</p>\n<p>My Dad was the first person I knew to have a computer. It was one he purchased at Radio Shack in the 80s. His experience with them predates Windows. Like lots of old-timers, he likes to talk about how much he paid for a 10MB hard drive back in the day. He used spreadsheets in DOS and used to be a master at writing batch files. Recently, he asked me to come help him with some IT issues. He has having problems changing the ink in his printer and wanted to make sure some important documents were getting back up. He's also mentioned not being able to remember how to access his photos or music. I was glad to help but I could see that he is starting to get frustrated by having to remember the procedures for tasks he's done for so many years.</p>\n<p>My Dad and I don't see eye to eye on many things, especially politics. I've never liked to verbally spar with him because emotions take over and I can't think straight. He has always been one of the most intellectually capable people that I know. A lifelong voracious reader, he's a walking encyclopedia about a great many things. Unfortunately, some of the facts he's assimilated in the last 15 years came from Fox News, an outlet not known for presenting both sides of an issue. We do best when we talk about computers or when he tells stories about my grandparents. There are a great many things he doesn't like because they differ from what he considers traditional. You've heard about the type of person who wishes life today was like the 1950s? That's him.</p>\n<p>Although he is financially able to afford assisted living for himself and my step-mother, he has so far resisted doing much more than just looking into it. He says that he is willing to pay for in home care, but so far he hasn't made any moves to get that underway. Maybe today's events will spur him into action.</p>\n<p>Every time I see him these days, I have to determine whether he's having a good day or bad day. He has a sensitive nature, so I have to be circumspect. I have done my best in adulthood to let go of resentments toward him with varying levels of success. It has not been easy and that's on me. I feel like he does the best he can. I might wish he were different, but he isn't. He is who he is, and my job is to accept that the best I can.</p>\n<p>As you may be able to tell, I am not a big fan of the aging process for me or anyone else, not that I have anything but wishful thinking to combat the process. I don't like the effects it has on me and I don't like seeing the way it changes the people I love. Writing this is the outlet for feeling that way.

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/linkage/mac-1.webp\" alt=\"mac\" /></p>\n<p>I started working in IT support right after Windows 95 was released. I’ve worked in manufacturing health care, banking and insurance, but primarily in K-12 and higher education. In some way or another, I’ve always been involved in end-user support. Currently I have a relatively low stress job at a well-run private university where the relationship between the IT department and the faculty, staff and students is pretty good.</p>\n<p>Almost every adult in 2024 has experienced technical difficulties that required them to call tech support, whether it’s the help desk at your job, your Internet service provider or the manufacturer of your cell phone. I’m not immune to this. I switched ISPs last year and my new setup didn’t work when I followed the directions. It was frustrating, but I wanted to solve the problem, so I called.</p>\n<p>I promise you that if you follow the steps below, your technology problems will get solved faster and with better results than if you don’t. And, trust me, I’m sure you’ve dealt with some incompetent or mean or unfriendly tech support folks in the past. I get it. That’s out of your control. What is in your control is how you react. Don’t act aggrieved or victimized. Be solution oriented and things will work out better.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Restart your computer. Seriously. This solves many, many problems. Do this even if you don’t think it will help.</li>\n<li>Answer all the questions you are asked truthfully. Don’t say you restarted you computer if you actually didn’t.</li>\n<li>Remember that the person on the other end of the phone almost always wants to solve your problem too. They are not the cause of your problem. Technology is complicated and finnicky and sometimes things don’t work. That’s the price we pay to live in the 21st century.</li>\n<li>Obey the Golden Rule. Talk to the person on the other end of the phone like you would want to be spoken to.</li>\n<li>If you are calling because you got an error message, know what the error message said and be able to relay that information to tech support. Don’t just say “I got an error</li>\n<li>Be prepared to tell tech support what you were doing when the problem occurred. (e.g., What program were you using? What other programs were open? Did the computer make any sounds?)</li>\n<li>If this is a reoccurring problem, how long has it been happening and what was your reason for not reporting it sooner? (Did you have a solution to the problem that no longer works?)</li>\n<li>Can you reproduce the issue or is it intermittent? If you can reproduce the issue, know what exact steps you took before the problem surfaced. (Keep in mind that intermittent problems are among the most difficult to resolve because of the difficulty in determining if the issue is fixed)</li>\n<li>What have you tried on you own to solve the problem? (Not that you have to solve your own issue, but it doesn’t hurt to Google it. It might be something simple that can save you a call.)</li>\n<li>Be familiar enough with the tools you use to know what operating system your computer uses and (especially if you are on a corporate network) what the name of your computer is.</li>\n<li>Do your best within your abilities to describe the issue. It’s not cute to use language like ‘thingy” or “doohickey”. If you don’t have the IT vocabulary to explain an issue, there’s nothing you can do about that. Just use plain language and you’ll be moving towards a solution.</li>\n<li>If you are having a problem with something online, try to know if your computer is wireless (bonus points if you know the name of the Wi-Fi network) or if it is connected to a network through a cable.</li>\n<li>Only call for help if you have the time to work through the problem. Don't call five minutes before a meeting or quitting time.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Look, I understand technology is frustrating. Trust me. I do. My whole professional life has been spent fixing things that aren’t working as expected. But don’t be angry at the person who is there to help you. There’s no need to tell them how many years you’ve been using a computer or what high-speed tech job your kid has. Just work together, get the problem solved and then you can get back to work.</p>\n<p>For Mac users who want to try solving their own problems, here are some resources.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.jamf.com/blog/mac-troubleshooting-101/'>Mac troubleshooting.

One of those is Shareful by Sindre Sorhus. The share\nmenu on the Mac seems like an afterthought when compared to the\ncomparable menu in iOS. Many developers fail to implement the feature in\ntheir apps, and Apple itself leaves it purposefully underpowered for\nsome reason. Thankfully, Shareful exists with three supremely useful\nfunctions.</p>\n\n<h2>Copy</h2>\n\n<p>Copy the shared item to the clipboard and so you can quickly paste it\ninto another app. This is my most frequent use case. I have a number of\nApple shortcuts that have text output. I use Shareful to copy that\noutput to use in other places. Without Shareful, I&#39;d have to use the\ntext to create a file, then open the file and copy from there. Another\nuseful option is to use this app to copy a screenshot to the clipboard\nthrough the share menu.</p>\n\n<h2>Save As</h2>\n\n<p>Choose a directory to save the shared item to.</p>\n\n<h2>Open In</h2>\n\n<p>Open the shared item in any app. You can open the current Safari URL in\na different browser. In Safari, click the share button, select &quot;Open\nIn…&quot;, and then select a browser. There is a Raycast extension that also\ndoes this if you are a Raycast user.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Frequent use cases:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>In Photos, use the “Open In” share service to open one or more photos directly in Photoshop.</li>\n<li>Quickly copy content from an app that doesn't normally support copying.</li>\n<li>In Safari, right-click an image, and use the “Open In” share service to open it directly in another app.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Shareful is available on the <a\nhref=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shareful/id1522267256?mt=12\">Mac App\nStore.</a> If you do not have access to the App Store, you can download\na version from <a href=\"https://sindresorhus.com/shareful\">the\ndeveloper&#39;s website</a>, although it is not updated as often.</p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Shareful - A Free App I Use Every Day' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

I impishly asked a reference librarian if she knew another word for “thesaurus”. Next thing I know there’s a deputy sheriff at my elbow. I thought I was off the hook because I used to work with him, but no. Out the door I went. At the used book store, I was looking at a book on wine. This is before I quit drinking, although I was sober for the purpose of this story. I think. Anyway, I’m looking through the book and I start finding big, gorgeous marijuana leaves, dried and pressed between the pages. There were a dozen or more. Laughing, I approached the front desk to show them. They didn’t think it was as funny as I did, and...you guessed it. Out the door I went. I still like to read though. I’ve never been kicked off Amazon.</p>\n<h2 id=everything-you-need-to-get-on-the-internet>Everything You Need to Get on the Internet</h2><p>Back in the days when people were just starting to get online, Walmart ran a special on 14.4 modems, complete with an AOL disk and a phone cord. On the box it said \"Everything You Need to Get on the Internet\". Someone bought one and called me (I did side jobs back then) to help them get it set up. When I showed up, they handed me the box and looked at me expectantly. I asked them where their computer was and they looked confused. They pointed at the box - \"Everything you need to get on the Internet.\" They didn't own a computer.</p>\n<h2 id=two-boxes-of-junior-mints>Two Boxes of Junior Mints</h2><p>I have three kids, two girls and a boy. For the most part, they got along well when they were living at home. Group dynamics being what they are, there were times when they would go to war along gender lines with the girls using their two to one advantage. My son is a gentle soul who's never done a mean thing in his life, but he would get so exasperated at his sisters that he'd contemplate extreme measures at times. Once they'd done something that drove him to a dark place and he issued one of the most famous threats in family history. Shaking with anger, he told his step-mom and I, \"If the girls don't leave me alone, I'm going to buy two boxes of Junior Mints and I'm not giving them any!\" That was it. That was the meanest thing he could think of.</p>\n<h2 id=getting-used-to-farm-life>Getting Used to Farm Life</h2><p>Prior to the age of 14, I'd been a city kid all my life. Then I loved to my uncle's farm, where I lived throughout high school. When I first moved there, he also managed a commercial hog farm, and I rode with him daily to work. As we moved around from barn to barn, I did my best to avoid stepping in anything unpleasant. Since there were thousands of hogs around, this was a difficult task, and it slowed me down considerably, much to his consternation. Finally, he couldn't take it anymore. He grabbed me by the arm, bent over and scooped something off the ground and rubbed it on my hand. He said, \"Now you've hot hog shit on you. Quit dancing around and keep up. Let's go to work.\"  A few years later, I was out in the cow pasture at home with a wheelbarrow picking up dried cow chips by hand to use as garden fertilizer. He saw me and brought up the earlier incident, remarking on how far I'd come in my farming career.\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

My favorite person is almost always there. My Internet is fast and my beloved MacBook Air is positioned right where I like to sit to surveil my little kingdom. Whatever I like to eat and drink is nearby and if I nod off, which I am prone to do, there is no one to hassle me. Yet five days a week, I have to voluntarily leave my little paradise and go to work in an office where people ask me to do things I don't want to do. I have to do them on someone else's schedule and I don't get much say so in the matter. As hard as it it is to believe, I have been living like this since the early 80s. Remarkable, isn't it?</p>\n<p>The worst day of the week is Monday. After two days of relative freedom and being able to sleep at will, my entire system is shocked by the return to \"work\". Just when I am getting used to the kind of lifestyle to which I would like to become accustomed, I get the shock to the system that returning to the workforce brings.</p>\n<p>If you too share in my detestation of Mondays, I have done some research for you to help alleviate some of the downsides of the whole experience.

They want to know his last meal request and if he wants a preacher to be with him. Ultimately, they even ask if he wants a chance to escape. The prisoner, named John Coffey, tells them he's ready to go, starting his speech with a resigned \"I'm tired boss.\" Brother, I can relate.</p>\n<p>Most of my working life hasn't been spent in a physically demanding job. Occasionally in educational tech we have to install computer labs or do large scale moves, but most of the work is honestly spent sitting down, alternately reading and typing. Sure, it can be mentally draining to do something repetitive or to solve a stubborn problem, but it doesn't make your back hurt.</p>\n<p>I have had hard jobs that took a physical toll on me. I've worked as a cook in a busy restaurant. I've framed houses, and I spent time in the infantry. I've spent eight-hour summer days walking backwards down the highway carrying a heavy shotgun guarding prisoners the state wanted people to see out on the roads working. My teenage years were spent on my uncle's farm and if that man believes in one thing, it's teaching  young people discipline through manual labor. I'm not unfamiliar with fatigue.</p>\n<p>Even my leisure pursuits for years were spent chasing the endorphin rush that endurance sports can bring on. I loved 100-mile bike rides and backpacking over mountains. Building up endurance is an adaptive behavior. If you train a lot, you can do some pretty miraculous things.</p>\n<p>The tiredness I'm aware of today, isn't a physical feeling though. It might be me yelling \"get off my lawn\" at the world, I don't know. What I'm tired of is a world that seems in some ways to be evolving for the benefit of the investor class and not for the working stiff. The last thing I want to do at the end of the day is to go to the grocery store and ring up my own order. The store I go to just took out half the cash registers and replaced them with self check out kiosks. Who wants that? I go to McDonald's for a cup of their fine coffee, and the only human I get to deal with is the one who sits the cup in front of me. All the ordering and paying is done through a giant panel that tries to upsell me at every turn. I'm even old enough to remember the days when people didn't have to pump their own gas. Why was that eliminated? It seems to have disappeared at the same time that gas got expensive.</p>\n<p>I'm also tired of having to exercise discernment when I used to be able to just believe stuff. I could turn on the evening news and Walter Cronkite would tell me the deal, or may John Chancellor or Harry Reid. These days, I have to make sure I'm not in someone's spin zone when I try to stay informed. Newspapers that were institutions, like The New York Times, Washington Post and LA Times, are now operated by people who wouldn't be good contestants on Fear Factor. Some of them wouldn't endorse a presidential candidate, and they all lean towards sane washing the half of the American political system that is now ruling us. To be blunt, they have no balls, and it makes me tired.</p>\n<p>I'm tired of a political system that's caters to a powerful minority. In the US, most people support a woman's right to choose. They support raising the minimum wage. They support equal (not special) rights for LGBT people. Do you hear me? Most people, the majority, support those things, yet they are always in contention because a party that has only won a majority twice in 32 years uses every under-handed dirty trick they can think of to subvert the will of the people. It's obscene.</p>\n<p>I'm tired of things that used to be free or nominally priced. My kids grew up going to the state run aquariums located in a couple of our coastal towns. Today I have to drop a C-note to take my grandkids. Camping spots at state parks used to be free or just cost a five spot and now they cost as much as some hotel rooms. It seems like libraries may be all we have left, and thank god someone already thought of them. Imagine someone proposing a free service like that today. They'd be labeled a crazy socialist and chased out of town.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, there are some things left that give me energy. Being able to exercise free speech fires me up. Seeing my southern state elect a Democrat (who is Jewish) for governor gave me energy. His opponent had labeled himself a Nazi and said he's like to own slaves. We also elected a Democrat for attorney general and state school superintendent. The Republican who ran for the school job had said she wanted Obama and Biden executed on TV and homeschooled her kids over sending them to public school. I am not without hope, and hope gives me energy.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/gree_mile-resized.webp\" alt=\"Gree_mile-resized\" /></p>\n<BR>\n<BR>[Enjoyed it?

In high school, some buddies and I would sometimes sleep under the stars on the hillside beside the pond on my family's farm. Later, my military occupational specialty was in combat arms, so I got to spend plenty of time doing the Army version of camping at Ft. Bragg, Ft. Hood and Ft. Irwin among others.</p>\n<p>When my kids were old enough, we liked going to Cliffs of the Nuese state park where I told such terrifying ghost stories that my son late confessed he'd been traumatized for life. My girls could take it or leave it, depending on their mood. They are both adventurous adults now with kids of their own.</p>\n<p>Wonder Woman's daughters grew up camping with her and her parents but they haven't gotten into it as adults. Theirs are the kids who live closest to us. We se them often.</p>\n<p>Despite our backpacking background, most of the camping we've done in our marriage has been car camping in state parks. There are several within a couple of hours of our house. We decided to take the five youngest to Jones Lake State Park for an overnighter this weekend. We have two campsites, three tents, miniature camp chairs and lots of snacks. The kids all brought electronics, of course, but they are more interested in fishing, playing cards and exploring the woods. I did a little research before we came for some activities to do with them and that's what I'm sharing today.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.parents.com/fun/activities/outdoor/17-camping-activities-for-kids/'>17 Fun Activities for Your Family's Next Camping Trip</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://runwildmychild.com/camping-with-kids/'>Camping with Kids</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://www.discoveringanew.com/blog-4/outdoor-activities-and-crafts-for-kids-while-camping'>Outdoor Activities and Crafts for Kids While Camping</a>\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

Even for people who make everything seem effortless, life still has difficulties. In my more tender moments, as rare as they may be, I try and remember that everyone has rough stuff they are dealing with in one way or another and the rest of us may have no clue what that is.</p>\n<p>One of the most difficult things for me these days is dealing with the people who just elected Donald Trump. When I am wronged personally, I usually can get to forgiveness pretty easily. After all, we forgive people not for their sake but for our own because holding on to resentment is toxic and it just wears you down. Personal wrongs are usually about single actions, though. When a person's entire value set allows them to turn the country over to someone like Trump, it's an indication of who they are at the core of their being. Yeah, it's hard for me to deal with.</p>\n<p>I've reached the age where the people in my life from previous generations are all in their 70s and 80s. Watching them walk unsteadily across the room using a cane or someone's arm is unsettling. My uncle, who has always been the best example of strength and fortitude to me is still one of the manliest men I know but the days him being the first person I think of when it's time to lift something heavy are gone.</p>\n<p>Having been very physically active for a number of years, I have found it hard to bounce back after having knee surgery. The purpose of the surgery was to give me back my mobility, the post recovery. I just haven't gotten my groove back. At this point, it is more psychological than anything else. I want to go to the Alps with Wonder Woman in the new year. I don't want to have to skip anything because I lack the stamina to do it.</p>\n<p>Other difficult parts of life in no particular order:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Not letting how I feel be reflected on my face</li>\n<li>Being asked to do something for someone they should be able to do for themselves</li>\n<li>Remembering where I left my phone, keys and glasses</li>\n<li>Figuring out my cell phone bill</li>\n<li>Getting web hooks to work on my websites, although I think I may have gotten there</li>\n<li>Small talk</li>\n<li>Anything requiring me to open the hood of my car</li>\n<li>Saying no to my grandkids</li>\n<li>Climbing anything (life-long struggle)</li>\n<li>Listening to most 21st century music</li>\n<li>Anything without coffee</li>\n</ul>\n<BR>\n<BR>[Enjoyed it?

It also <a\nhref=\"https://fedica.com/\">has a web interface.</a> The platforms it\nconnects to are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Twitter/X</li>\n<li>Instagram</li>\n<li>YouTube</li>\n<li>TinkTok</li>\n<li>Facebook Pages</li>\n<li>Mastodon</li>\n<li>Bluesky</li>\n<li>LinkedIn</li>\n<li>Pinterest</li>\n<li>Threads</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You can post polls and threads on platforms that support them, plus you\nget unlimited drafts to store posts you may want to make later.</p>\n\n<p>There are some paid options geared more towards business owners than\nindividuals that offer scheduling more than 10 posts and getting more\nfrequent reports, but they are expensive, starting at $29.99 a month.\nFor personal use, the free options are fine for most people.</p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Fedica - Post to Multiple Social Networks at Once, On a Schedule - For Free' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/fannie_lou_hamer.webp\" alt=\"Fannie_Lou_Hamer\" /></p>\n<p>A certain type of person cares very much about their constitutional right to own a gun so that they can defend themselves and their family from any perceived threat. They obviously believe in the need for a violent solution to a potential problem and are willing to take on all the added danger that owning a gun brings to their lives. Hey, after all, who wouldn't do whatever it takes for their family, right? Usually, that very same person is also adamantly against providing any type of accommodation to immigrants from countries where street violence is endemic, making the U.S. the only feasible sanctuary. It might cost them an extra fifty cents a day on their federal income taxes after all. Not only that, the more brown people there are in the country, the greater the chance that they might have kids, earn the right to vote, or speak Spanish in the presence of \"real\" Americans.</p>\n<p>The same person who feels good because they adopt a kid from the Angel Tree at work every Christmas or because their church has a soup kitchen once a week has no problem supporting a political philosophy that would curtail food programs for the poor and eliminate Meals on Wheels for the elderly. They have a tremendous sense of entitlement for everything they feel they have earned and no sympathy for people who aren't in the same circumstances. Lots of people in the military lean conservative (not all though!). If you make a tour of barracks day rooms, you're likely to find lots of TVs turned to Fox News. Despite that, you will not find a more duplicitous, malingering, dishonest, getting free stuff from the government group of people than a service member at their discharge physical. There are people who specialize in helping them come up with every conceivable reason to get VA money for the rest of their lives for dubious medical reasons.</p>\n<p>On the flip side, there are those who put themselves on the line for people whose circumstances they'll never share. Every straight high school kid who joins their school's Gay/Straight Alliance voluntarily risks bullying by homophobes. If you look at the roles of civil rights martyrs, you'll see the names of people like Mickey Schwerner and Andrew Goodman who lost their lives helping people register to vote. Plenty of white people who enjoy all the privileges that their skin color gives them are adamantly opposed to white supremacy in all its insidious guises. Fannie Lou Hamer famously said, \"Nobody is free until everybody is free,\" and lots of people take that to heart and make it their creed.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure what makes a person lack compassion and empathy. Whatever it is, it's unattractive and malignant. When you don't care that poverty, hunger, and untreated diseases exist as long as you've got yours, well, you have lots of company. It seems that the price of gas and eggs is more important to a whole lot of people than anything that might help the less fortunate. And, that's just it. It's more often fortune that dictates one's circumstances than it is blood, sweat, and tears. It's fortune that picks your birthplace and your skin color. It's fortune that lets your job continue to provide for you when others lose theirs. It's fortune that your neighbor's house burned down and not yours. It's fortune that you don't have a crippling illness.</p>\n<p>I don't like associating with people who lack compassion. I don't understand their selfishness. I don't want to see them gloat and blame poverty on the poor, blame illnesses on the sick, and claim that any attempt to address the patriarchy, racism, or homophobia is \"identity politics.\" My people are the people who care. My people are the people who make a difference. My people are the ones who make whatever claim America has to greatness a reality.\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

TV channels, music services and software. Was\nlife better when we all just paid a single cable bill instead of cord\ncutting? Was it better when you had to pay an upfront price on any\nsoftware you wanted to use? I don&#39;t know the answer to that. I remember\nwhen it cost nearly $300 to get a copy of Microsoft Office with Outlook\nIncluded, which didn&#39;t include anything like cloud storage or a free\nemail account. Cable bills got to be well north of $100 a month. These\ndays, you can use Office in about five minutes for less than $10. If you\nget a good deal and sign up for a full year, you can often get a premium\nTV subscription for roughly the same amount per month.</p>\n\n<p>Keeping track of all this is challenging though. An old-fashioned\nspreadsheet might do the trick, but for a polished experience with a few\nextra bells and whistles, I use an app from Touchbits, Inc. It&#39;s called\n(wait for it) <a\nhref=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/subscriptions-track-expenses/id1577082754\">Subscriptions</a>,\nand it cost either $1.99 a year or $7.99 for a lifetime purchase ($14.99\nfor a family license). It is a universal app, so it works on your phone,\niPad and on your Mac.</p>\n\n<p>For me, it ticks all the boxes. It lets me categorize each subscription\n(entertainment, software etc.). I also have the option of using tags for\nfurther categorization. It can handle weekly, monthly and annual\nsubscriptions. There is a place for the URL associated with my account\ninformation for each sub. You set a renewal date for when the next bill\nis due and for what amount. There is a reminders option for those due\ndates. You can select a payment account if you want to track that. The\nSubscriptions app saves a price history so you can see what changes\nvendors make over time. Finally, there is also a notes field.</p>\n\n<p>The app has analytics to help you track spending over time and by\ncategory. There are several view and sorting options as well. The data\nsyncs via iCloud across all platforms. You can export your data via a\nCSV. It has a backup and restore feature, but it is a proprietary\ndatabase file and there doesn&#39;t look there is a way to import data from\nanywhere. I&#39;ve been using it for nearly a year, and I&#39;ve recommended to\nlots of people.</p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=The Best App for Subscription Tracking' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

Prior to 2002, opening more than one website at the times required opening multiple instances of a browser. Memory management wasn't as robust as it is now and computers had much less power. These days you often hear of people running hundreds of tabs at the time since browsers can hibernate unused ones easily. I am nowhere near that level, mostly because I don't have the headspace to make use of them all. I normally have two or three windows open at a time depending on whether I'm at home or work.

Sure, people have varying degrees of talent, but I prefer an open society that encourages folks to try their hand at things. It is much better than one that acts like the plebes should stay on the sidelines while the real pros do their thing. That's why I don't find it the least bit pretentious when anyone describes themselves as an artist, regardless of the form they choose. I smile when I see anyone present a drawing or a poem or a landscape photo to the world. It's an attempt to bring something conjured in one's creative spirit to life, shared with the hope that it will spark a feeling in others.</p>\n<p>When I look at the effort it takes to write regularly, I know that it takes a muse of some sort. It takes real effort to come up with an idea, flesh it out, polish it and present it. I give bonus points when someone's post contains a hint of vulnerability, a confession that not everything in life is easy. \"Hey world! I have a wart! Want to see it?\" Laugh if you want to, that's a thing an artist would say. Let's face it, it's hard to come up with something original in a world filled with people who can say whatever they want, whenever they want. Just the act of trying conveys a certain sense of bravery.</p>\n<p>Emily Dickinson never saw one of her poems published, yet she continued to write breathtaking poetry for the entirety of her life. Stieg Larsson wrote the entirety of the Millennium Trilogy (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) and died before it was published and became an international bestseller. There are many other examples like them. Artists write because they have something to say, something they have to get out. It's not about being recognized or lauded as much as it is about creating because doing so is a representation of our own humanity. When Og, the cave man, was drawing on the walls of his home all those years ago, he had no concept of received admiration. HE just had something inside himself that he wanted to get out.</p>\n<p>Most of us have bloggers we admire. I told Keenan last week that I wasn't jealous. I just wished I could write the way they write. They responded kindly, saying, \"I like the way that you write like you.\" What an affirmation. To me it means I've practiced my own art form enough to have developed my own style, something recognizable. That's the thing about almost any skill. When you practice, you get better. Malcolm Gladwell famously wrote about the 10,000-hour rule, where he proposed that The Beatles, Bill Gates and other successful people reached the heights they did because of how much they practiced, how much experience they had. That's why I write every day without fail. This is my art form and I want to get better at it.</p>\n<p>That's why I don't give any credence to the criticism of blogging challenges. Writing every day isn't a gimmick. It isn't forced, necessarily. It is learned behavior and discipline. Writing is just taking what your thinking and putting the words down on record. If you think every day, and you do, then you can write every day. No one said making art was supposed to be easy. Picasso probably had days when he asked himself, \"What the hell am I going to draw today?\"</p>\n<p>To all my fellow artists, do your thing! Do it often. Do it for yourself, and to hell with the rest of the world. Internal validation is the best validation.\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

There are services out there that\noffer to clean all that up for you, but they are expensive and require\nthat you turn your credentials over to a third party. Luckily, there is\na universal Mac app that can do total or selective removal of your\ncontent from 30+ different apps, websites and services. It&#39;s called <a\nhref=\"https://redact.dev/\">Redact Privacy</a>. It removes posts, DMs,\nphotos, videos, likes, and other unique content on various social\nnetworks. You can delete by keyword, sentiment, content type, and more.</p>\n\n<h2>\n<br />It has a free tier that will :</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Delete unlimited tweets, retweets, and likes from Twitter/X</li>\n<li>Anonymize unlimited Reddit posts and comments</li>\n<li>Delete up to 30 days of content on Discord &amp; Facebook</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To access the other services requires a subscription, but paying for a\nsingle month for $7.99 should give you adequate time to clean up your\nposts. Subscribing lets you take advantage of scheduled deletions if for\nsome reason you need that.

After last week's election and Musk's role in it, there is another mass migration under way. Part of me thinks \"better late than never\" and part of me thinks\"you should have been gone already.\" To e fair, I wasn't a big Twitter user. I didn't delete my account immediately because I rarely used it.  It was never all that important to me and in my first six months on Mastodon, I posted more than I did in 15 years on Twitter. Still, I was very much aware of it and made use of it during times of fast breaking news. I preferred to monitor things like presidential debates through Tweets rather than subject myself to watching them on TV. When January 6th in all it's ugliness was happening, I followed it on Twitter.</p>\n<p>Anyone with an interest in the Internet or the social history of the 21st century might get a whiff of nostalgia looking over the history of the platform. The idea for it was sketched out in a single day at its predecessor company, Odeo. A picture exists of Jack Dorsey's legal pad with a rudimentary sketch of the information flow that was imagined. We know who the first person to coin the term \"tweet\" was and we know who and when introduced hashtags, a carry over from IRC to Twitter.</p>\n<p>To those who spent much time on the platform, nothing has really replaced it. I love Mastodon and plan to use it for the foreseeable future but it isn't the same. Neither in Bluesky or Threads or anything else. I don't know if the fractured outlooks people have on the world will ever again allow something like it to flourish.</p>\n<p>Take a trip down memory lane. Look at what we had.

My ability to lapse into unconsciousness is my <a href='https://louplummer.lol/what-is-your-superpower/'>superpower</a> and one for which I enjoy a certain bit of notoriety among my friends and family. But, when I am done with a nap or a night's sleep, I'm not one to lie there and try to drift back off. When I am done, I am done. I'm ready to get up and do something else. I love to get up most mornings. The thought of that first cup of coffee and the chance to catch up on eight hours of missed news is too tempting to pass up.</p>\n<p>I am nearly robotic upon waking, which is normally around 4:30 AM. We have one of those wonderful Nespresso one-cup coffee makers that brew great coffee quickly. I stand by it, bleary-eyed but patient as I wait for it to dispense its life-giving elixir. I make my way to my laptop, disconnect my backup drive, and begin the morning IT routine. First, I start my <a href='https://amerpie.lol/2024/03/29/my-daily-note.html'>daily journal in Obsidian,</a> one I will transfer to <a href='https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/day-one-is-popular-for-a-reason'>Day One</a> at the end of the day. Then I add my daily app review, written the day before, to Reddit at <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/macapps/'>r/MacApps.</a> I don't even link back to my blog anymore. The moderators there added <a href='https://apps.louplummer.lol'>AppAddict</a> to the sidebar, and that drives plenty of traffic my way. Then I check <a href='https://social.lol/@amerpie'>Mastodon</a> and Micro.blog to see if I got any messages overnight. My friends in Europe are typically active already, so I see what they're up to.</p>\n<p><a href='https://louplummer.lol/wonder-woman/'>Wonder Woman</a> gets up at the same time I do. We spend the first 30 minutes or so together before she leaves for her morning run. Sometimes she's only gone for 30 minutes or so, but it is not unheard of for her to run a half-marathon before work, particularly if she's working from home and has a bit more time. Prior to having my knees replaced, I used to go for a walk in the mornings, a habit I need to rekindle. I loved being out on the dark streets listening to music or a podcast.</p>\n<p>One of the other things I enjoy looking at in the morning is retrospectives from the day's history. I can do this in the Photos app, in Day One, and on Facebook, where my account is now 16 years old. It's fun to be reminded of past getaways, and to see pictures of my grandkids when they were younger. What's not so fun is to see what outrage Donald Trump has committed on this date in history. As an example, today I see posts relating to his quid pro quo attempt with Ukraine when he withheld military aid in an attempt to get them to investigate the Bidens. That got him impeached the first time.</p>\n<p>By the time Wonder Woman has returned from her run, I am usually into the part of my morning that many people find funny. It's my pre-work nap. Despite just having slept for eight hours and having consumed coffee, I normally try to doze off for another few minutes before showering and getting dressed for work. For most of my working life, I had to leave a great deal earlier than I do now. I used to have to be on the job at 7:30 AM. My office was 30 miles away. These days, I don't have to be at work until 8:00 AM to an office that is less than 10 miles from home.</p>\n<p>As much as I enjoy my job, a low-pressure tech support role at the same university where Wonder Woman is a big wheel, I don't always relish the start of the day. I routinely remark with something grouchy and profane when she summons me to get in the car for my chauffeured ride across town to our lovely campus. By the time we get moving though, I cheer up. My wife is my favorite person. I enjoy the brief interlude to chat about the day ahead, to crack jokes, and make plans for the evening. Everyone should be so lucky\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

I found a\nsimple tool by indy developer Arthur Smith, <a\nhref=\"https://arthursmithdev.gumroad.com/l/TextCount\">Text Count,</a>\nthat makes it easy to get character, word and sentence counts and to get\na readability score on the Flesch-Kincaid scale. It analyzes sentence\nlength and word length, plus syllable count to assign a score from 1-100\nto the text. The higher the score is, the better. Most business\ncommunication should fall in the range from 60-70. A low score indicates\nthat you need to simplify what you&#39;ve written.</p>\n\n<p>Another useful element of Text Count is an estimated reading and\nspeaking time. The app does not require you to paste the text anywhere.\nIt analyzes what you copy to the clipboard. For people like me, who do\ntheir writing in a text editor instead of something like Microsoft Word,\nit&#39;s a handy tool.</p>\n\n<p>Some high-end writing apps like <a\nhref=\"https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/ia-writer\">iA Writer</a> have\nsome of these tools built in. <a\nhref=\"https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/obsdian-s-many-uses\">Obsidian</a>\noffers a word and character count out of the box, and you can download a\nplugin for a readability score.</p>\n\n<p><br />Text Count is $2.99 at <a\nhref=\"https://arthursmithdev.gumroad.com/l/TextCount\">Gumroad</a>.</p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Text Count - An App for Those Who Write' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

Starring Olivia Coleman, David Tenant and Jody Whitaker. Any of the three of them makes any show worth watching but the fireworks and raw emotion of Broadchurch are something special. Make sure you watch the British version of the show. For some weird reason, an America version was filmed and it is a poor comparison.</p>\n<h1 id=the-wire>The Wire</h1><style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/LYgKmOJT_gM' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Regarded by many as the best television show ever made, the five season's of The Wire loosely follow the Baltimore Police Department and drug gang while also spending time with longshoremen, politicians, newspaper reporters and school teachers. All of these intermix in an unflinching look at the intertwined cultures of a modern American city. The acting, the screen writing and the directing are all excellent. Some of the characters from the show live in my imagination years after watching the show for the last time.</p>\n<h1 id=the-sopranos>The Sopranos</h1><style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/2X4UhSPA5d4' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>A classic by any measure, The Sopranos removed the glamor and mysticism from the mob created by The Godfather and revealed the extremely flawed human beings who make it up. Like The Wire, the screenwriting and acting is top notch and the characters unforgettable. It's almost impossible to watch one episode at the time if you have more available.</p>\n<h1 id=the-fall>The Fall</h1><style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/dyFrBC1rAcg' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Starring two of the world's beautiful people, Jamie Dornan and Gillian Anderson, this story of a Northern Irish serial killer and the cop, imported from the Metropolitan Police to track him down is as suspenseful as anything I have ever watched. A scene that takes place in Belfast hospital emergency room after a shooting is a revealing testament to the combat medical skills doctos in that part of the world learned during The Troubles.</p>\n<h1 id=lonesome-dove>Lonesome Dove</h1><style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/q5vskCOPEeg' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>I regard Lonesome Dove as the best American novel ever written and this television adaption starring Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Duvall among many others may be the best network show since Roots. It tells the story of an epic cattle drive out of Texas and has everything you'd ever want in a western. It's a must watch</p>\n<BR>\n<BR>[Enjoyed it?

To further obfuscate things, I don't believe I am actually sick either, just feeling the after affects of a couple of vaccinations. This has happened to me as punishment for telling Wonder Woman that I've never felt bad after getting a shot, possibly insinuating that people who do are experiencing a psychosomatic reaction. She said her arm was a little stiff at the injection site, prompting me to wave mine around, windmill fashion to show that I was just fine.</p>\n<p>I generally escape the variety of communicable diseases that seem to plague some folks. Thirt years of working in the close confines of first a prison and then public schools seems to have given me the immune system of a plague doctor. While others complain of reoccurring sinus infections, bronchitis or other upper respiratory illnesses, I just get the sniffles once in a while or a mildly stopped up nose, both of which are adequately handled by OTC medications.</p>\n<p>When I do come down with something, I usually have company. Wonder Woman and I have lived through two bouts with Covid, a horrible flu and joint food poisoning from a sketchy Mexican restaurant. We lie in bed together so that our kids won't have to wonder around the house to find our bodies if we end up dying. The bad case of flu happened when one of our daughters was visiting at Christmas. Her family drove all the way hear from central Florida and barely got to see us since we rarely ventured out of our bed room as we did not want to infect them.</p>\n<p>I am not one of those men the Internet likes to mock when I don't feel well. I am not prone to moaning or any sort of drama. What I want more than anything is to be left alone. Headaches and bodily aches and pains tend to make me a little cross and ill natured. I usually don't feel up to any sort of prolonged conversation. I want nothing more than to be left alone so I can sleep. Sleep is the great cure all. The more I am unconscious, the less awareness I have of my plight and the better I like it.</p>\n<p>Being sick on a weekend is the worst. You don't even get an unexpected break from work since you are already off. Thankfully, my white collar job offers PTO so if there is a need to stay home, my pay won't get docked. I remember the jobs I had early in my life when no work meant no pay and often those types of jobs also wanted a doctor's note, forcing you to actually pay to take a sick day. Isn't American great?</p>\n<p>If I were one of those science denying Republicans, or RFK, Jr., I would be fine since that type no longer believes in the proven efficacy of vaccinations for some reason.

Out of\nthe box, it is preconfigured to search Google, Bing, Wiktionary, Google\nTranslate and Wikipedia. Adding other search options is a breeze. I\nincluded AllMusic, YouTube, Amazon, Max, DuckDuckGo and Reddit in just a\nfew minutes. I have not included any AI searches in my setup, but they\nare just as easy to set up.</p>\n\n<p>Using it is as easy as selecting the text and opening Snapsrch with a\nhotkey. If you don&#39;t have any text selected, and you invoke the hotkey,\nyou can type a query into the popup. You can choose the window size you\nwant for the popup, by selecting user elements for iPhone, iPad, Mac or\ncustom. You can also choose to invoke Snapsrch with a mouse or trackpad\ngesture. If you are a Popclip user, there is an extension available to\nadd Snapsrch. This allows you to consolidate any search terms you are\nusing into one icon, decluttering the Popclip interface.</p>\n\n<p>Other Snapsrch options allow you to hide custom elements of any search\npage you create and to have them load to a specific location on the\npage. Snapsrch has OCR capabilities in several languages, so you can\neven search for text in images and videos. There is a built-in history\nof your searches you can toggle on or off. It is helpful when you need\nto refer back to a previous search.</p>\n\n<p>Snapsrch is available <a>on the Mac App Store</a> for $5.99. You can use\nthe trial version as much as you want. You just get a popup asking you\nto purchase it every 50 uses.</p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Search Selected Text with Snapsrch' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

This is a story about a particular time on the Internet when ethics were a little more cloudy than they are today, or at least that's my story and I'll be sticking to it. Somewhere around the turn of the century, two things collided in my world. I became one of the first people in my city to get broadband internet by virtue of having signed up on the waiting list years ahead of time when it was first opened up. The other circumstance was the heyday of Napster, a program that let you share your music collection for the rights to access the collections of other people, which you could then download at will.</p>\n<p>Napster debuted in June of 1999, and by July of 2001, it was shut down by court order. This was a time before purchasing and downloading music online was widely available. The iPod and the iTunes store were still several years away. The way most people obtained music was by driving their car to the store and purchasing CDs. If you wanted to listen to music on your computer, you either slipped the CD into the drive or you went through a process known as ripping, where each song was converted into a format known as MP3. Hard drives were much smaller at the time, so you really had to keep an eye on disk space. I used a Windows computer I'd built myself in a giant tower that was almost three feet tall. It had room for three hard drives and a CD drive, all of which I used.</p>\n<p>Rolling Stone Magazine, then and now, was fond of creating lists of songs and albums for music fans to argue about. I found an article online with their version of the top 500 albums of all time. I copied the entire list into an Excel spreadsheet and added two columns: HAVE and NEED. I went through the list and checked off the albums I already owned. As a classic rock fan, most of the highly regarded albums by The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, and the like were ones I already owned. I didn't have any hip-hop, and my soul and blues albums were pretty sparse. It was definitely a white boy's music collection.</p>\n<p>Each night after supper, I would sit down at my computer and search first for entire albums and, in some cases, for individual songs to piece other albums together. I relied on a website that still exists to this day, <a href='https://www.allmusic.com/'>Allmusic.com</a>, to find the track lists for the albums since the Rolling Stone article I used didn't have that information. I would listen to the tracks to make sure I wasn't getting a live version if I was trying to build a studio album and vice versa. Some songs were shared at a low quality, forcing me to download second and third copies to find ones that matched what I already had.</p>\n<p>I was in my mid-30s while I was doing this, probably at the north end of the Napster-using demographic. The typical user was a college student with a computer connected to their school's broadband connection. Most people at home were just starting to give up their screeching dial-up for cable modems and DSL lines at the time. Because Napster skewed towards younger people, finding older albums—particularly ones that were out of print—was difficult. Two I remember searching for over a months-long period were Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music by Ray Charles, released in 1962, and Phil Spector, Back to Mono (1958 - 1969). The latter album, in fact, was the last one I needed to complete the entire 500 album collection. I remember the night I finally completed it.</p>\n<p>As a result of searching for and curating the editions of so many songs, I was exposed for the first time to classic 90s hip-hop in the form of Dr. Dre's The Chronic and N.W.A.'s Straight Outta Compton. I got my first Frank Sinatra album, In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning. Hank Williams, Willie Nelson, and Johnny Cash all had albums on the list, and so I found out that I enjoyed their brand of country music. I found blues artists like Little Walter and Bobby Bland.</p>\n<p>For a moment in time, I had a veritable music museum available to me. I could discuss and play just about anything a critic could name as being influential to the modern music scene. Over twenty years have passed now. When Apple released their top 100 albums of all time last year, I was deeply, deeply offended when I realized I didn't have them all. In fact, I didn't have anything by Frank Ocean or Kendrick Lamar, two of the artists with top 10 albums. Not only that, I couldn't even name any of their songs. That's on me. After Napster was shut down, I once again started purchasing music, both CDs and through downloads. My musical taste shifted from classic rock to alt-country, which is what I like to listen to today. For a period of time, though, I was on top of the musical world.\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

One wears a hat and gray shirt, resting on a log.\" /></p>\n<p><strong>This question was asked by <a href='https://curiousmagpie.weblog.lol/2024/11/geese'>Curious Magpie.</a> It has also been answered by <a href='https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/11/ask-me-anything-3'>Anniegreens</a>. Do you experience Hiraeth (a deep longing for something)? What is it you long for - a time, a place, a feeling?</strong></p>\n<p>The greatest adventure of my life was my honeymoon, a blissful 156 day long-distance hiking journey that saw my new wife and I walk across 14 states along the Appalachian Trail. I think and talk about it often and probably always will. Even the best of regular life has its monotony. You sleep in the same place. You see the same things when you look out the window. The clerk you see at the supermarket rang you out last week and when you return next week, they will ring you out again. It's very possible to be extremely happy amidst all that sameness, bit it can hardly be described as an adventure. It's more like contentment.</p>\n<p>During the time we spent walking through the mountains, every day brought things we'd never seen before. Every night we slept in a new place, whether it was a tent site, a shelter or a boisterous hostel in some trail town. Long distance hikers have only three things that are constants: the unending evaluation of their energy levels, the location of drinkable water and the decision on where to spend the night. Everything else is just the relentless magnetic pull down the trail, putting one foot in front of the other, moving toward the terminus of their journey, no matter how far distant.</p>\n<p>The pure physicality of the journey makes for many, may opportunities for small victories. Every single time you make it to the top of a mountain, it means that you've won. Every time you wade across a river, your unbeaten streak continues. When you cross into another state, it is both a finish line and a starting line in a slow race to the next border. It doesn't take long during a through hike to achieve peak fitness. Any excess body weight melts off. There is real magic in knowing that you have earned the ability to do almost anything you desire with your physical skills. When you see day hikers along the trail, huffing and puffing as they labor towards a peak and you saunter pass them with your fully loaded backpack, knowing they are climbing but one mountain that day while you are climbing a half dozen, you can't help but appreciate the hiking machine you have become.</p>\n<p>One of the true joys during that journey was the chance to appreciate things we take for granted during our normal lives. When you spend most nights in a sleeping bag that is growing increasingly dirty as you lay on the ground inside your tent or the hard wooden boards of a shelter floor, the chance to get a rare hotel room as you hike through a trail town is magical. Sliding between clean sheets on a soft mattress with air conditioning is to experience true luxury. Imagine living off cold poptarts, oatmeal made with creek water, unrefrigerated cheese and the other foods that make up a backpacking diet. Then, while you're making your way through the incredibly rough wilderness of southern Maine, you come to a town like Rangely and you sit down for a restaurant meal of fresh lobster. You know in your heart of hearts that nothing will ever taste that good again.</p>\n<p>As adults without trust funds, we have worked without much of a pause since our teens. We were privileged to take a six month break from that grind because my wife sold her partnership in her business. Just the freedom to be able to live a life that isn't tied to an obligation to report to X location to do X task for eight hours a day, five days a week was a once in a lifetime opportunity. When you can live your life without having to be responsible to anyone but your partner, the days have a different flavor. People often remark that if the two of us survived teh stress of walking 2,000 miles together, then we must be destined to be together. They do not know how much truth there is to that observation. We became so in tune with each other, do defendant on each other for mental, physical and emotional support. It has lasted through the entirety of our marriage.</p>\n<p>So there it is. That's what I long for. All of those feelings and experiences during that period of my life are precious memories. I will always have them.\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

With it, you can bring back anyone from the dead from any era, at any point of their life and for only one day. Who do you resuscitate for 24h, at what point in their life and to do what?</strong></p>\n<p>This is the kind of question meant for me. I love history and I am prone to spending a great deal of time pondering things that will never happen. I have contemplated what I would do with my lottery winnings for hours despite the fact that I don't buy lottery tickets. I'm bad at math but I'm not that bad at math.</p>\n<p>After last Tuesday, I'm tempted to say that I'd be willing to bring back Lee Harvey Oswald. I'd get him a good military grade rifle, not that Italian made mail order thing he used last time. Of course, Lee loved Russia, having lived there. His wife was also Russian so it might be hard to persuade him to do the job so he might not be the best candidate for this experiment.</p>\n<p>With what America is facing right now, I also think that bringing back Dr. King for a 24-hour marathon strategy session would be a good idea. Aside from the power he conveyed with his amazing oratorical powers, he was also an organizing genius and man who could inspire others to do hard things. He successfully led the Montgomery bus boycott and the March into Selma. He advised the people of Birmingham how to deal with Bull Connor. I think he could quickly analyze the current political situation and help the resistance, such as it is, on a plan to mitigate the damage that's going to happen over the next four years. I'm thinking though, that it might be too heart breaking to only have him for a single day. I don't know if we could stand that loss again.</p>\n<p>As long as Paul McCartney is still alive, I'd be tempted to bring back John Lennon for a day, give him a guitar, a pen and some paper and lock the two of them in the studio at Abbey Road with a supply of strong tea and some good weed. There have been many good song writers in the rock era but no one even comes close to those two guys. I don't know if they could put together an entire album in 24 hours. I'd settle for just a couple more songs to listen to for the rest of my life.</p>\n<p>Since this exercise has been pretty male-centric, I think I'd better also think of a few women to consider. I'd definitely want to talk to someone smarter than me, someone creative with a unique way of explaining the world. Three candidates that quickly come to mind are Dorothy Parker, Virginia Wolfe and Sylvia Plath. It would be really cool if Denis would let me cheat and bring the three of them back simultaneously. Can you imagine being in the room to hear that conversation? I wouldn't say a word. They could all be pretty scathing and I don't think I'd want to risk becoming famous for being humiliated by a memorable one-liner.</p>\n<p>Forced to choose someone outside of the 20th century, I think I'd got with Henry David Thoreau. I love smart and eloquent people. He qualifies. I think I'd come up with a series of questions for him to pontificate upon. We'd go for a walk in the park that now exists to preserve the site of his famous cabin. I would tape everything he says and have it transcribed. It would make a best selling book and I'd happily live off the profits for the rest of my life.\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

After turning on Vivaldi&#39;s\nbuilt in tracker, ad and third party cookie blocking, I added uBlock\nOrigin Lite and tested security at <a\nhref=\"https://adblock-tester.com/\">Ad-Block Tester</a> and <a\nhref=\"https://d3ward.github.io/toolz/adblock.html\">Toolz Adblock</a>,\nscoring a 99% effectiveness rate on both of them. Vivaldi has built-in\ntools to block cookie popups across the board.</p>\n\n<h2>Power Consumption</h2>\n\n<p>Vivaldi allows you to set custom hibernation times on individual tabs or\non stacks, its name for tab groups. You can also set Vivaldi to  open up\nwith lazy loading, where tabs stay in a hibernating state until you need\nthem. I typically operate with two or three windows and 30–45 tabs at\nall time, so this presents a good opportunity to really reduce battery\nstrain.</p>\n\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n\n<p>To avoid distraction, I wanted to use the identical colors I&#39;d used in\nEdge. Modifying the default theme only took a couple of minutes using a\ncolor picker and hex codes.</p>\n\n<h2>Tab Management</h2>\n\n<p>When you open Vivaldi for the first time, you are asked to choose if you\nwant vertical or horizontal tabs. You can move them later if you decide\nto. You can also take advantage of split screen tabs, allowing you to\nview two web pages side by side. My favorite feature out of all the\ntools is saved sessions. You can save all your open tabs and reopen them\nlater from a button on the left side toolbar. This is a separate feature\nfrom the workspaces that Vivaldi lets you create and reopen as needed.\nYou can even go a step further and use a separate profile with a\ndifferent email address to keep your work and personal browsing from\nmixing. This lets you use different extensions, passwords and settings\nat every level.</p>\n\n<h2>Built in Mail, Calendar, Notes and Feed Reader</h2>\n\n<p>It was easy to set up my primary Gmail account and the Yahoo account I\nuse just for newsletters. Adding a selection of Google Calendars and\nApple Calendars was also a breeze. While I prefer to use my subscription\nto Inoreader for my full-blown RSS needs, it is convenient to stick a\nfew of my favorite sites in the Vivaldi built-in feed reader for quick\naccess.</p>\n\n<h2>Side Panel</h2>\n\n<p>Vivaldi has an option to any site you want in a panel on the side of the\nbrowser, helpful when doing research with Wikipedia or looking up\nbookmarks on Raindrop.io. You can also view your browser based bookmarks\nthere along with notes, downloads, history, your reading list, a\ntranslation service, a list of tabs from across all current Vivaldi\nsessions on multiple computers, saved sessions, calendars and tasks</p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=A Day With Vivaldi Browser' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

The scumbag billionaire. Marc Andreessen, was once a brilliant software engineer who led the way in introducing Netscape (previously known as Mosaic) to the world. The market share it garnered was north of 95%/ The next major shift was to Internet Explorer, the browser installed on all Windows machines from Windows 95 through Windows 8. It swallowed the Internet and eventually had as large a market share as Netscape ever did. Then, here came Google. It's Chrome browser is nearly ubiquitous today, despite it's many faults, primarily privacy concerns and battery drain on mobile. Many Mac users stay with the default browser on their computers, Safari, which is also native in the iPhone.</p>\n<p>Chances are, you are probably a Chrome or Safari user unless you're a techie, in which case chances are you may be a Firefox user since it has better privacy than it's main competitions. If you have been using the same browser for a long time, I'm suggesting that you try an alternative for a few days, just in case you're missing something.</p>\n<p>Every major browser has import options that let you bring in your bookmarks, passwords and history if you are currently using one of the major players.</p>\n<p>Here are a few choices:</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/download?form=MA13FJ'>Microsoft Edge</a> - this has been my workhorse on Windows, Mac and iOS over the past two years. It is a stable browser with a huge variety of features, most of which are easy to turn off are hid if you don't want to see them. It's based on Chrome, so the extensions available are plentiful. You can read more about <a href='https://amerpie.lol/2024/01/09/microsoft-edge-really.html'>why I like it here,</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/'>Firefox</a> - this descendant of Netscape is the one of the most private of browsers and it still allows you to use the most powerful ad-blocking extensions (<a href='https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/'>see uBlock Origin</a>) which are being phased out in Chrome based browsers. For an open source alternative using the Firefox engine, try <a href='https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/the-zen-browser'>the Zen Browser</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://brave.com/download/'>Brave</a> - this is another browser for the security minded with built-in blocking of ads, trackers and third party cookies, which also makes it pretty fast. It has a built in version of Tor for browsing that is untraceable for all practical purposes. Based on Chrome, it has a wide variety of available extensions.</p>\n<p><a href='https://kagi.com/orion/'>Orion</a> - a browser developed by the private search engine, Kagi, is also privacy focused, promising zero telemetry and the ability to use either Chrome or Firefox extensions. It claims to block more ads by default than any other browser. It is 100% funded by Kagi users.</p>\n<p><a href='https://vivaldi.com'>Vivaldi</a> - this browser's claim to fame is extensive customization. You can place your browser tabs just about anywhere you want, turn on ad blocking with downloading an extension, and enjoy end-to-end encryption of your synced data. I am currently giving it a try.</p>\n<p>I am not going to link to Arc, the favorite of many people over the past couple of years because its parent company recently announced they don't intend to update it any further and weren't all that clear on where they are headed going forward. IMHO, it's a gamble to use Arc with it's steep learning curve and radical differences to the browser paradigm right now.</p>\n<BR>\n<BR>[Enjoyed it?

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/-7.webp\" alt=\"TimeTravel\" /></p>\n<p>Ask Me Anything - Where (and when) would you go if time travel were real?</p>\n<p>Should time travel ever be invented, I think those of us living in 2024 are going to be pretty safe from being visited from the future. No one is ever going to look at this era and think, \"Man, I'll bet that was a fun time to be alive!\" Nope, they're going to look at this version of America and want to stay as far away from it as possible. In fact, other than the night that Obama won the election in 2008, most of the truly memorable moments of this entire century to date have been horrible, starting with the botched election in 2000 and then 9/11 the following year. Follow that up with war and the financial crisis and year after year of Donald John Trump and you don't get a time traveler Disneyland.</p>\n<p>If I could travel in time, I'd be content just to see of the 20th centuries greatest hits. I think I'd enjoy going to one of the monumental concerts from the decade of my birth, the 1960s. Of course, Woodstock is the first thing to pop into my mind, but it was pretty wet and muddy for a good portion of the time, so I'd probably choose the Monterey Pop Festival in June 1967 so I could see acts like The Animals and Simon and Garfunkel and get to watch Jimi Hendrix literally light his guitar on fire. I'd definitely go to Liverpool, England in the early 60s to watch the Beatles play at the Cavern Club before they got famous.</p>\n<p>I would go to the March On Washington in 1963 and watch Dr. King give that speech on the very spot where the 2013 version of me later got married, right on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. I'd like to go down to Mississippi after the Civil Rights Acts was passed and watch Fannie Lou Hamer vote for the first time. I'd definitely spend some time on college campuses, probably at places like Berkley and Columbia, to see the student movement in action. I'd go to the airport in San Francisco and buy beers for the GIs coming home from Vietnam. I'd verify that the right wing myth of spitting protesters is indeed a lie.</p>\n<p>Then I'd probably get back in the time machine and go back to the 50s, just so I could go to Yankee Stadium on October 8, 1956, to see Don Larsen pitch a perfect game in the World Series against the Brooklyn Dodgers. I'd get good seats behind home plates, and I'd be ready to watch Yogi Berra jump into Larsen's arms after the final out. There's not much else I'd want to see of the 50s, except maybe the look on Rosa Park's face when she got out of jail for not giving up that bus seat. She is one of my heroes.</p>\n<p>Going back to the 40s, I'd attend the funeral of FDR. If ever there was a right man at the right time for a job, it was him. He guided the US through the great depression and then straight into World War Two where he assembled a staff and alliances that resulted in a victory over fascism. I know he had faults. We all do, but he was a giant and there is a lot to admire there. I'd probably listen to a couple of Churchill's speeches in the House of Commons too. I'd love to be there to hear him say \"We shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be. We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing-grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills. We shall never surrender!” He's another flawed guy, but he did the job when Great Britain needed him.</p>\n<p>The 30s were pretty rough, but there were still some things worth seeing. I'd go right to the heart of Nazi Germany and the 1936 Olympic Games just to see Jesse Owens destroy the myth of Aryan superiority as he defeated the master race and won four gold medals in sprinting and the long jump. I'd laugh as Hitler rushed out of the stadium to avoid shaking his hand, and I'd smile as Owens mounted the podium to the sounds of the Star Spangled Banner playing for all the Nazis to enjoy. I'd also do whatever I had to do to find Woodie Guthrie and listen to him sing his songs, even if I had to make my way into a hobo jungle in the rail yards.</p>\n<p>I don't know a lot about the first two decades of the last century. I think I'd like to see that total badass named Teddy Roosevelt, the day he gave a campaign speech after being shot in the chest and before going to the hospital. Furthermore, I'd like to see big Jack Johnson, the first black heavyweight champion, defend his title. If I wouldn't stand out too much, I'd go to New York City in 1919 to watch the World War One victory parade to see the Harlem Hellcats return from France. I'd also hang out at the polls to watch women come to vote after the passage of the 19th amendment.</p>\n<p>Finally, I'd zip forward to other moments. I want to be on the White House lawn in 1974 to watch Richard Nixon get on the helicopter after resigning the presidency after members of his own party told him they would no longer support him because of his crimes, showing that people like Barry Goldwater had more morals than today's Republicans. Finally, I'd go to the Dakota apartment building on December 8, 1980, to try and stop Mark David Chapman from killing John Lennon. That would change the future, certainly, but only for the better.</p>\n<BR>\n<BR>[Enjoyed it?

Using a quick keyboard\nshortcut, users have been able to summon a window into which they could\ntype or paste information. Hiding the note and bringing it back was\neasy, but there wasn&#39;t a lot more to it than that. With the recent\nrelease of Raycast notes in version 1.8.5, floating notes have been\nreplaced with a new feature.</p>\n\n<p>Raycast notes now support markdown. If you know the syntax, great. If\nnot, the notes window has a toolbar where you can select bold, italic,\nbullets and so on. It also has &quot;inline code and code blocks, lists that\nyou can indent and reorder, checklists, links and more.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Raycast users without the pro plan can have up to five notes, while pro\nmembers get an unlimited number. There are built-in commands for New\nNotes and Search Notes. If you use the commands frequently, then, like\nany other command in Raycast, you can assign a hot key to them.</p>\n\n<p>The action pane (⌘+K)l for the Raycast notes command has several\nchoices:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>New note</li>\n<li>Browser notes</li>\n<li>Copy note deep link</li>\n<li>Create Quick link</li>\n<li>Format</li>\n<li>Disable window auto-resizing</li>\n<li>Export (HTML, Markdown, Plain text)</li>\n<li>Recently deleted notes</li>\n<li>Delete</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Quick links allow you to open a note with a single keystroke. The notes\nwindow may be moved anywhere on the screen. It will stay on top until\ndismissed.</p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Raycast New Notes Feature Available Now' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

Each one has a few good tips on being yourself and keeping your profile updated, but they also tend to veer into subjects like \"building your personal brand,\" using AI to \"help\" you and using scheduling software to help you \"maximize your engagement.\" I get some of that if you're marketing your lawn care service or jewelry shop on Etsy, but not if you are seeking community with fellow travelers in the 21st century.</p>\n<p>My reasoning for engaging is social media is two-fold.

I also like meeting interesting and like-minded people who are into the things I enjoy, blogging, tech and furthering progressive ideas. I normally follow people back who follow me. I look at people with skewed ratios of followers as being maybe a little full of themselves sometimes, but it's not really any of my business.

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/chip2-resized.webp\" alt=\"chip2-resized\" /></p>\n<p>Today's question comes from the <a href='https://library.xandra.cc/indieweb-carnival/'>November Indy Web Carnival</a> - \"Has someone had a profound impact on you?\"</p>\n<p>My transition from a person who viewed the world as something that just happens around us to a person who sees the world as a place that is ours to change came about under the tutelage of a unique man whose life story is unlike anyone I've ever met. I became interested in a local group formed to oppose the death penalty. Even when I was an uninformed, apolitical prison guard, I knew at a deep level that state-sanctioned killing was wrong. Even though I'm not religious and the name of the group was People of Faith Against the Death Penalty, I decided to attend. That's where I met the most revolutionary man with whom I've ever been associated, a man with the unlikely name of Chip Smith.</p>\n<p>Chip was from Philadelphia's main line. His father had been a research scientist for a pharmaceutical company and ended up a wealthy man. Chip was nearly 70 when I met him, and he still had a trust fund left to him by his father, but he was hardly typical of that breed. In the '60s, while the war in Vietnam was raging, Chip had gone to work for the Agency for International Development in Laos, living among the American community there, rife with CIA agents and other clandestine operatives. When he returned to the United States, he fell into the radical left movement and stayed there for the rest of his life.</p>\n<p>American communist and socialist organizations have Byzantine family trees. Groups continually split over differences in political philosophy and tactics. I can't describe every group Chip was a member of, but in 1979 he was a part of the People's Viewpoint organization, composed mostly of educated professionals who went to work alongside the working class to organize them into what would hopefully become a revolutionary movement. Despite having a doctorate in economics and that trust fund I mentioned, Chip went to work in a steel mill and became a shop steward in the union. His wife, an actual neurosurgeon by trade, went to work in a garment factory. The organizing of the People's Viewpoint organization came to a bloody end in November 1979 when a rally they organized in a Greensboro, NC housing project was attacked by the KKK in an ambush the police knew was going to happen and did nothing to stop. Five people were killed.</p>\n<p>Chip's wife went back to work in the hospital, but Chip kept on working towards revolutionary changes in the U.S. By the late '90s, the organization he was a member of in Philly had a plan for members to move to the U.S. South to organize. Despite the bloody history that had touched their lives, Chip and his wife moved to NC. His plan was to join local progressive groups, assist them in their mission, and help them grow. He successfully mentored us into actually getting the city council of our city to endorse a death penalty moratorium in a campaign that succeeded. NC hasn't had an execution in 17 years.</p>\n<p>When 9/11 happened and the U.S. government went to war, Chip used his extensive contacts to help the little peace group we organized do things like help military resisters, hold giant demonstrations, and direct military families towards others like them against the war.</p>\n<p>On a personal level, he taught me so much. I learned about the history of the Palestinian people from Chip. I had no experience with organized labor or unions, being from the least unionized state in the country. Chip taught me what they've done for workers and why they are needed. Chip patiently taught me about the societal cost of white privilege. In fact, he wrote a book about it. Chip taught me about the importance of inclusion, about how as two white guys, we should work towards building organizations that valued women and people of color. I spent many, many hours riding around the state in Chip's old van, going to meetings at labor councils and organizations like Black Workers for Justice. He never talked all that much, but everyone knew him and respected him.</p>\n<p>He wasn't just a political mentor either. When I was struggling to get sober, Chip and his wife were there for me, kind of like loving but very disapproving village elders urging me to do better. Eventually, his wife took a position in a hospital a couple of hours away, and they moved. Of course, he immediately identified the issues most pressing to the workers in that area, joined a local organization to help them out, and worked with them until he died a few years later, dedicated until the very end to making a better world with other people.</p>\n<p>When making decisions, I often ask myself what Chip would do in my situation. He never got too bent out of shape about the news of the day, viewing the struggle for revolutionary change to be a long and slow, but constant, process. In these trying times, I do my best to emulate that thought process. I believe in my heart of hearts that people, organized together towards a common goal, have immense power. I learned that from Chip Smith.\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

If you are new to the platform or\ndon&#39;t want to make the investment in a paid program right now, there is\na simple and easy to use app for you. <a\nhref=\"https://macscheduler.net/\">Scheduler for Mac</a> can do all the\ntasks outlined above. It can run AppleScript, shell scripts and python\nscripts. Scripts can be run as root. Here are a few real world examples\nof how I use scheduling:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Open my web browser to my job's time clock web page four times a day to clock in and out for the day and for lunch</li>\n<li>Run an AppleScript right before I get up in the morning to eject my backup drive so that all I have to do is unplug it</li>\n<li>Run an AppleScript every night to move items in Things 3 to a new date and time</li>\n<li>Launch a file synchronization app every night to sync my Obsidian vault to Google Drive</li>\n<li>Open and close an app on my work and home machines at alternating times because I don't want it running on them simultaneously</li>\n<li>Launch a set of documents I use all day every day at work five minutes after I log in.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The interface for Scheduler is straightforward and easy to use. You&#39;ll\nhave no problem configuring any of the events. You can even group events\ntogether to run at the same time. Any event can be run on a schedule or\nset to the same time on specified days. You can toggle events on and\noff, for example, if you don&#39;t want them to run when you are on\nvacation. One of the conditions for setting up a script allows it to be\nrun after a specific period of inactivity. You could use this to quit\nyour open apps and log you off in case you forget to. The option to\ndisplay messages can be used as an alarm clock.</p>\n\n<p>Another powerful feature of Scheduler is the ability to assign hotkeys\nto events. Using this you can launch apps, open websites and documents\nand run scripts right from the keyboard. You can even launch them from\nthe Mac menu bar, which is a convenient way to do things like refresh\nFinder or restart your dock after making changes. You could even update\nyour Homebrew apps that way.</p>\n\n<p>The preferences and option for Scheduler allow you to sync or back up\nyour settings to iCloud. You can also sync events to any iCloud calendar\nyou grant Scheduler access to. Scheduler was released in 1998. The most\nrecent release was last year. It is currently on version 7. It&#39;s\nfreeware but requires you to register it after 30 days of use.</p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Scheduler for Mac - Free Automation Utility' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

There's something to be said for feeling your feelings and processing grief, but prolonged feelings of sadness produce cortisol and are physically, not to mention mentally, bad for you. Plenty of folks can have a couple of drinks or burn one and relieve a little pressure but that isn't an alternative for the recovering community or other abstainers.

In addition, you specify a\nfile location of your choosing for files you drag into Dockside.

Any item placed on a shelf that has Quicklook capability is\nviewable via that mechanism. Dockside also maintains a recent files\nhistory in its interface.</p>\n\n<p>Dockside is an Apple notarized app that can operate offline since it has\nno external server connection and collects no data on users.

Spent a great deal of time trying to turn a 30 second task into a 15 second task by automating what happens when I download pictures on my computer. I looked for a new program to test so that I could write a review. I did not have the energy or desire to get far from my desk. I did absolutely zero doomscrolling of the news. I didn't read a single article about the cloud hanging over America.</p>\n<p>After lunch, I decided what I really wanted to do was just quit my job. I've already retired once, didn't like it so I returned to the workforce. I was looking for something to blame for my malaise today and instead of assigning that blame to existential dread, I figured it just had to be the low pressure, easy job I lucked into. Yep, that's it. I started emailing Wonder Woman all the reasons I wanted to quit. To her everlasting credit, she let me rant and didn't freak out. In the end, I didn't put in my notice, but I didn't feel better either.</p>\n<p>I don't want to go to sleep because I'm scared of what will be on my phone when I wake up. I mean what if the worst happens? I have no idea what I will do. For a long time I thought I would just withdraw into my hobbies, delete all the news apps from my devices and become apolitical, finding some way to not feel guilty for the fifty million tons of privilege that would allow me to do that. I know better. I've been reading the news without pause since the days of Watergate. I would not know how to stop.</p>\n<p>My entire early adulthood was taken up by 12 straight years of Reagan/Bush. The thought of my dotage being taken up by something worse is horrifying. If old, straight, white guys are feeling this way tonight, what must the politically aware POC, women and LGBT citizens of America be feeling?</p>\n<p>Is this incoherent? I don't feel like I have the words to express my anxiety, my anger and my confusion. It's not supposed to be like this. I'm so angry at the people who encouraged this, who allowed it to happen and who stand to benefit from it. I want someone to pay.\\</p>\n<p>I'm not a control freak. Most of the time I hold my chin up and deal. Like everyone else in the world, I've survived everything that has ever happened to me. I'll survive the next week and the next four years, no matter what. Right? Right?</p>\n<p>Someone asked me to write a blog post on whether I have faith in the future of humanity and I have been putting THAT off until after tonight because whatever happens today is really going to color my answer. That's overblown and over dramatic but it is also true. All we need is more air and water pollution and drill, baby, drill and \"I'm not a scientist\" types. I just want to scream profanity.</p>\n<p>America is a mental ward tonight and there aren't any doctors available.\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

It would be cool to have nearly 60 years of accumulated knowledge crammed into an 18-year old head. Let's go.</p>\n<h2 id=yep-go-to-college>Yep, go to college</h2><p>All the people out there making noise about how college isn't for everyone and that becoming a plumber or joining the army are good solid alternatives, you know the ones I'm talking about, those people are anti-education conservatives who went to college themselves and who plan on sending their children. They are trying to cover for the inability or unwillingness to make education affordable to the masses like the social democracies in Europe do—the countries that aren't sending half their tax revenues to defense contractors. People who go to college make more money, have longer life expectancies, and are happier than the people who don't go.</p>\n<h2 id=do-not-join-the-military>DO NOT JOIN THE MILITARY!!!</h2><p>I am a vet and I do not hate the military, but it is not a job program, nor is it safe if you happen to be female. One out of three people who enlist do not finish their service with an honorable discharge. The usual pattern for that segment of enlistees is a general discharge for some sort of misconduct, health issues, weight issues, or incompatibility with military life. For those who don't complete their enlistment, all of the wonderful benefits described by their recruiters are no longer attainable, including the educational benefits.</p>\n<h2 id=exercise-and-eat-right-starting-now>Exercise and Eat Right Starting Now</h2><p>Don't wait until you get out of shape to start exercising. Make going for a walk or run and going to the gym a habit starting right now. Just get used to the idea that you need 30 minutes to an hour each day to take care of your body. I'm not telling you that you can't eat pizza. I'm saying don't eat a whole pizza. Also, if you never worry about your alcohol consumption, then you are doing it right. If you do worry about it, that's a very good sign that drinking is not right for you. Weed probably isn't a better alternative. You need to get used to getting high on life.</p>\n<h2 id=start-practicing-gratitude>Start Practicing Gratitude</h2><p>Every day for the rest of your life, take a minute and write down three things you are grateful for. Your list doesn't have to be deep and philosophical. Did you find a good parking space today? Write that down! Did someone treat you nicely today? Write it down! Make it a habit to be continually on the lookout for things to be grateful for. It will do more for your outlook on life than anything else I can think of.</p>\n<h2 id=vote-democrat>Vote Democrat</h2><p>The Republican Party is a front for the top 1% of Americans on the wealth scale. They've discovered things that fire up white people and made that what they pretend to represent, but what they are really about is maintaining a system in this country where the richest people get richer and the rest of us fight over the scraps. I'm not saying that the Democrats are perfect because they are not, but they do not preach white supremacy, the subjugation of women, and the perpetuation of the war machine above all other government functions like the Republicans do.</p>\n<h2 id=avoid-debt-as-much-as-possible>Avoid Debt as Much as Possible</h2><p>Go to a state-supported school, preferably one that has reduced tuition. Start a habit of saving money from your very first paycheck. When you want something, start saving for it instead of borrowing money. There is a huge difference between what you need and what you want. Internalize that fact and let it guide your spending habits. You may want a fancy car, but what you need is reliable transportation. You may want a big screen TV in your dorm room, but all you need is the laptop you use for school.</p>\n<h2 id=miscellaneous-advice>Miscellaneous Advice</h2><ul>\n<li><p>Use protection. Kids are great and I love mine, but unplanned pregnancies change your life.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href='https://gomilpitas.com/jokes/kurt-vonneguts-commencement-address/'>Wear sunscreen.</a> Kurt Vonnegut was smart AF and he said that so I am going with it.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Stay close to your family.

Saturday he's heading up to Santa Fe and that makes him a lucky man. My wife and I spent a week's vacation there a while back and it was fantastic. There are so many great places to eat, hike, ride bikes and make day trips to. If you are into art, there are plenty of museums and galleries to captivate you.</p>\n<p>Here are a few places I can recommend from personal experience.</p>\n<h2 id=hikes>Hikes</h2><p><strong>Chamisa Trail</strong> - in Santa Fe is a beautiful hiking trail that offers stunning views of the surrounding landscape. It is a popular destination for both locals and tourists looking to explore the outdoors. You can find more information about Chamisa Trail in Santa Fe by visiting this website: <a href='https://www.santafenm.gov/chamisa_trail'>Chamisa Trail Santa Fe</a>.</p>\n<p><strong><a href='https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/new-mexico/armijo-trail-and-faulty-trail-loop'>Armijo Trail</a></strong> - Explore this 4.7-mile loop trail near Cedar Crest, New Mexico. Generally considered a moderately challenging route, it takes an average of 2 h 11 min to complete. This is a very popular area for hiking and horseback riding, so you'll likely encounter other people while exploring.</p>\n<h2 id=restaurants>Restaurants</h2><p><a href='https://sfshed.com/'>The Shed</a> - Located in a building dating back the the 1660s - We offer locals and visitors alike a time tested taste of the best that Northern New Mexico has to offer both in cuisine and hospitality. We are a family owned and operated business now under the management of the 3rd generation of Carswells. Visitors and locals returning to Santa Fe don't feel like they have arrived in Santa Fe until they have tasted the Shed chile once again.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.bumblebeesbajagrill.com/'>Bumble Bee's Baja Grill</a>- Great vegetarian, vegan and gluten free options along with organically raised meats. \"When we say the “freshest of ingredients” we mean that all our meats are freshly grilled to include a fine selection of skirt steak, natural New Mexico lamb, Mahi-mahi from off the coast of South America, farm raised shrimp, skinless chicken breasts and tender pork carnitas which are braised and slow-cooked in special spices. We also prepare whole natural chickens that are marinated with our secret recipe and roasted on an imported French rotisserie. Fresh vegetables and fruits are brought in daily to prepare the savory garnish and fillings that adorn many of the selections.\"</p>\n<h2 id=drive>Drive</h2><p><a href='https://www.newmexico.org/places-to-visit/scenic-byways/high-road-to-taos/'>The High Road to Taos</a> - This route takes the traveler through an authentic remnant of Old Spain, still evident in the religion, architecture, topography, history, and people along the route.\nThe byway travels through Chimayo, a community known for the beautiful Santuario de Chimayo and the El Posito, a hole in the floor of a side chapel filled with healing earth. Along N.M. 76, the byway follows through the creased and crinkled badlands, polka-dotted with scrubby piñon and juniper, with the Jemez Mountains enormous on the horizon.\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

				"title": "A Trip That Changed Me from Ask Me Anything",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/opt-2024-11-04-1.webp\" alt=\"Paris Demo\" /></p>\n<p>My Internet friend, R. Scott Jones, asked - <strong>What's one place you've traveled to (or perhaps an entire trip) that changed you? Tell us how you changed because of it, and why you think it inspired that change.</strong></p>\n<p>I've lived for all but a very short period of my adult life in the same southern military town where I went to high school. Most of my vacations have been to the beaches or mountains of the same state I live in. My military service took me to places like Texas and California, but never out of the United States. Then, over a period of three years during the beginning stages of the US war in Iraq, I became a traveling fool. My activism against that war took me to college campuses and demonstrations all over the US and Europe.</p>\n<p>The way that happened was a matter of luck, politics, and maybe a tad bit of exploitation. I learned a lot about group dynamics, organizing, and the far left as it exists in the United States. I was a member of a tiny little community group in Fayetteville, NC, protesting the death penalty and other social justice issues. Then 9/11 happened, and George Bush and Co. decided to attack Iraq because 19 Saudi Arabians attacked the US. My son was in basic training in the Navy on 9/11 and was on the way to report to the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower after completing Navy Nuclear Training when the first bombs fell on Baghdad. He was home on leave and went to a demonstration against the war and held a sign that said \"No Blood for Oil.\" He was interviewed by an AP reporter. When he reported to the ship, he was brought up on charges and convicted. It was bullshit because even members of the military have free speech when they are off duty, out of uniform, and not purporting to represent the government. Thousands of GIs did it during the Vietnam War.</p>\n<p>I was pissed about the way he was treated and told the story at a small gathering of activists I attended. In attendance was an instructor from the University of NC-Greensboro who was a member of the International Socialist Organization (ISO). He led the student group there and had ties with the national headquarters in Chicago. He approached me and asked if I would mind coming to his school to speak, and I agreed. I didn't know that I was being auditioned. When I spoke at the school, members of the national cadre were there, and they liked what I had to say and how I said it. Before I knew it, speaking invitations started pouring in. I was eager to represent Military Families Speak Out, a national organization I was trying to organize for, so I went to every place I was invited.</p>\n<p>They asked me if I wanted to go to Paris to speak at the World Socialism Conference on an anti-war panel, and I agreed. I didn't even have a passport and had to hustle to get one. I was there for nine days. My roommate was a man named Shuja Graham, a former Black Panther given the death penalty for the death of a correctional officer in a prison riot, later exonerated, as he was not actually involved in the murder. I'm a former prison guard myself, but Shuja and I got along just fine. I met leftists from all over the world and started to see some of the nitpicking differences for which that strain of politics is known.</p>\n<p>I didn't do much classic tourism, other than visiting Notre Dame and the Seine one afternoon. I spent much time talking politics and drinking. I went to a demonstration organized by the French League of Communist Revolutionaries and bought a Palestinian scarf from the Italian Communist Party, whom I later learned were Stalinists. My hosts, the ISO, were Trots, disciples of Leon Trotsky, an early Communist thought leader assassinated on Stalin's orders. Most of my far-left-leaning political friends back home belonged to an organization associated with Maoism.</p>\n<p>When I returned home, I continued to speak out and travel, eventually going to Italy and Great Britain on ISO-sponsored trips. As the anti-war movement grew, some activists got lots of press, like Cindy Sheehan, the mother of a soldier killed in Iraq who gained fame for camping out in a ditch outside of Bush's Texas ranch. Another became known for appearing in Michael Moore's movie, Fahrenheit 911. GI resistors started getting attention and invitations to speak. People organizing against the war competed to see which well-known person they could get to come to their demos. Factions developed. It was distasteful. The ISO cadre, whom I had come to look upon as my friends, suddenly wanted to dictate to me where I could and could not speak, depending on the politics of the organizers. I was outraged because I was on one team, Team Stop the War. That was my goal. I wasn't trying to grow anyone's membership or advance some nuanced understanding of far-left politics. I just wanted for kids like my son to quit being sent to die in Iraq.</p>\n<p>Although I remained very much against US policy, I made the abrupt decision to quit traveling and speaking after making one last trip to Atlanta for an event that had nothing to do with any political group. Thereafter, I attended meetings of the same hometown organization I started with and went to our tiny demos happily. My adventures on the national and international stage were enlightening, and I got to meet a lot of military families and hopefully discourage a few young people from joining up. My adventures with the ISO, of which I must stress, I was never a member, were enlightening, if for nothing else, to see a small slice of American culture that most people never experience.\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

My\nintention was to keep a regularly updated archive of my 19-year-old\nGmail account containing 155K messages. I also wanted to retrieve a\nYahoo account that I use solely for newsletters.</p>\n\n<p>I knew beforehand that it&#39;s extremely easy to use Google Takeout to\ndownload an archive of your email in the universally recognized mbox\nformat because I&#39;ve done it several times. My Gmail archive weighs in at\nabout 8GBs. You don&#39;t get a lot of choices when you request the archive,\nthough. You get it all from the beginning of time. I wanted one to\nimport into Eagle Filer so that I could have offline access to all the\nreceipts, registration information and other things I&#39;d received via\nemail since 2005. Google Takeout did the trick.</p>\n\n<p>With Mail Archiver X you can filter the emails you choose to archive, a\nfeature I wanted. Unfortunately, despite supposedly being able to add\nfiles to an archive and cumulatively grow it over time, I was never able\nto get that function to work. Either the program insisted on downloading\nan entire archive each time it ran, taking hours, or it only downloaded\nfiles since the last time I ran it, but in a new file, so that I could\nnot search my entire account at one time. Their tech support answered my\nemails, but not with helpful information. The company is in the US and\nthe person who answered my email did not appear to a native English\nspeaker. At present, support is no longer free. They have a $70 fee.</p>\n\n<p>The other thing about the app I don&#39;t care for is its size. It&#39;s over\nhalf a GB. That&#39;s just the program, not the archives it creates. I would\nnever recommend this program to anyone.</p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Mail Archiver X - Give It a Pass' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

I didn't go to war, as the period between 1983 and 1989 lacked one to send me to. They only needed a few guys for the invasions of Grenada and Panama, and I wasn't one of them. I've lived in military towns for most of my life. I'm also a committed progressive, somewhat to the left of almost everybody you probably know. I've learned over the years that no one on either side of the political spectrum has an objective view of the people who actually serve in the military. People on the right insist that they are all heroes fighting for our freedom, even the truck mechanics who spent four years in the motor pool at Ft. Hood and got out. People on the left vacillate between calling them victims of the war machine and mercenaries, depending on which ones they are talking about.</p>\n<p>Practically the only folks who have an objective view of who soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines are, are those men and women themselves. Here's what one of my friends, a former special operations soldier (Green Beret) said about himself and his fellows on why or why not military service makes you more American than other people.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>They volunteered to be there, they get compensated for their time just like any other person that works any other salaried job, they have employment benefits rarely seen outside silicon valley and wall street, they travel the world, have the opportunity to pursue degrees at no cost, and the majority of their day is spent just sitting around waiting to go home. Once they leave service, if they have long-term effects from service they will be compensated for those for the rest of their life tax free, have access to healthcare for reduced cost, reduced cost life insurance, access to programs and services that allow them to build business, buy homes, and send their children to school with no money out of pocket, and will be able to tell outlandish stories with little ability to be fact checked even in our social media obsessed culture. BUT, they are more American because they do something that you feel guilty for not doing yourself. Like the garbage collectors, the police, firefighters, teachers, janitors, landscapers, painters, carpenters, roofers, plumbers, teachers, nurses, etc…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href='https://thepointmag.com/survey/military-life/'>Military Life | The Point Magazine</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://www.quora.com/What-is-something-that-civilians-dont-realize-about-the-military-and-its-members'>What is something that civilians don't realize about the military and its members? - Quora</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2012/08/06/public-veterans-agree-most-americans-dont-understand-military-life/'>Public, Veterans Agree: Most Americans Don’t Understand Military Life | Pew Research Center</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://www.dfas.mil/militarymembers/payentitlements/Pay-Tables/'>Defense Finance and Accounting Service > MilitaryMembers > payentitlements > Pay Tables</a>\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/opt-2024-11-03-1.webp\" alt=\"Lou and Wonder Woman\" /></p>\n<p>The November Ask Me Anything blogging challenge is going well. Today's question is once again from @annie@social.lol on Mastodon. She wants to know, \"What's an important lesson you've learned about relationships?\" As a happily married guy, albeit in marriage number four, I feel fully qualified to share my expertise on this one. Anyway, relationships also include friends, work, and more.</p>\n<h2 id=high-school-sweethearts>High School Sweethearts</h2><p>I got married the first time to my high school sweetheart. I was 18, she was 17. We already had a baby and had another one pretty quickly to boot. Today, all four of us are doing OK. Getting an early start on children made me a young grandparent able to do plenty of stuff with my huge collection (13) of descendants. Although the marriage didn't last long (three years), it did not ruin my life in any appreciable way.</p>\n<h2 id=dont-marry-someone-you-meet-in-rehab>Don't Marry Someone You Meet in Rehab</h2><p>I don't really need to explain this one, do I? Also, ten-year age gaps create certain realities, many of them not positive. 1/10 Would not recommend!</p>\n<h2 id=even-good-relationships-can-wither>Even Good Relationships Can Wither</h2><p>I think it's fine, healthy even, to have interests and hobbies different than those of your partner, but interests and hobbies need to take second place in a marriage. The most important thing in a marriage is the other person in it. Taking them for granted or assuming that all the hard work is in the past is unwise. That's all I have to say about that.</p>\n<h2 id=good-relationships-have-requirements>Good Relationships Have Requirements</h2><p>It is quite possible to be true to yourself and also put your partner's needs at the top of your list. My relationship with Wonder Woman works because I have respect for her needs. I know what things are important to her, and I accept that without argument. She does the same for me. She kind of had to train me, and I had to allow myself to be trained. I don't think either one of us has extravagant demands. We have evolved into a couple that spends most of our time together. Most of what we do, we do together. I don't go running with her, but I do go to most of her races. When we are at home, we spend most of the time in the same room, often within an arm's reach of each other. We always kiss goodbye, including before work, at lunch, and before sleeping.</p>\n<h2 id=work-is-hit-or-miss>Work is Hit or Miss</h2><p>In the job I retired from, I made several friends that outlasted my employment. A couple of them have lasted more than 20 years. We've done things socially, been to each other's houses. I've watched them get married and have kids just as they've watched my family grow. I believe in being friendly with the people I work with and finding out about their lives. I had the same boss for many, many years, and the guy was so disinterested in everyone who worked for him. He didn't know anything personal about his employees, and I just marveled at his indifference. Most work relationships don't evolve into friendships, but I think it's important to humanize my co-workers and not see them as cogs in a machine.</p>\n<h2 id=organizations>Organizations</h2><p>I'm an outspoken and energetic person. When I'm in a group of people with a common purpose and something needs to be done, I don't mind voicing my opinion about the direction we take, nor do I mind stepping up to do the work. I don't know how to be any other way. The upside to this is lots of people appreciate you. The downside is a lot of people resent you. I don't like being resented, but what I like even less is a group of people staring at each other, waiting for someone else to make the first move.\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

It&#39;s an app with a GUI, not\na command line. You can trigger actions via events on your computer, or\nyou can schedule them. The program will run from a thumb drive if you\nneed to perform the same task on all the computers in a lab or an\noffice. Tasks are saved as files and can be shared among workstations.\nSamples include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Automatically connect network drives at login</li>\n<li>Automatically print all documents placed in a certain folder</li>\n<li>Automatically copy images when a certain external drive (including thumb drives) is connected</li>\n<li>Open or quit applications on a schedule (I use scheduling to launch a program that syncs my Obsidian vault at 3am, one that ejects my backup drive before I wake up so I can just unplug it and to move screenshots and image files from my daily work to a storage location when I am done for the day)</li>\n<li>Turn off automatic Time Machine backups and run them on a schedule</li>\n<li>Empty the trash on a schedule</li>\n<li>Take screenshots at scheduled intervals</li>\n<li>Display a dialog box (useful for public computers to pass info to users)</li>\n<li>Automate the opening of URLs</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are dozens of other tasks, and they can all be strung together to\ncreate a practically endless amount of tasks. As a bonus for\ncross-platform users. Compatible tasks can be shared between Macs and\nWindows machines with little alteration.

I would turn myself into a natural people person on the spot. I'd love to live in a world where relationships were easy for me. I can come across as personable and friendly, and there is a large part of me that truly is that way, but it takes so much effort. I make the effort because I enjoy the rewards and reactions I get from being that person, but my god, it takes so much energy and concentration. Left to my own devices and true nature, I'd silently do my own thing, content to be left alone most of the time.</p>\n<p>For a long time in my life, I acted very taciturn, rarely showing much emotion other than irritation. I was pretty gruff. It was all to keep people at a distance because I was so clueless about how to deal with them. I grew up moving once or twice a year, and my first 14 years on planet earth were spent always being the new kid. I didn't know what it felt like to be settled or to have long-term relationships. As an immature new kid, I felt like I always had something to prove, and if it backfired, my natural inclination was to angrily withdraw.</p>\n<p>In early adulthood, I dealt with substance abuse and mental health issues, both of which I sought treatment for, and after a myriad of struggles, finally got on top of. When I finally entered long-term sobriety, I realized that I absolutely needed people in order to be healthy, and that's when I decided to drop the gruff, grouchy, grumpy nature that I had always used. I was 43 years old. At work, I adopted the attitude that I would have were I self-employed instead of a civil servant. I really concentrated on being friendly and approachable and started thinking about how other people felt. I was at that job for 20 years, and I'm still friends with people from there. All of them will tell you that I had a mid-career personality change.</p>\n<p>In my personal life, I decided to start sharing the things I loved, which at the time were 12-Step meetings and riding my bike. I'd spent the last decade heavily involved in activism, always struggling against the things that made me mad at the world. Bush's wars, Conservative attempts to punish LGBT people, criminal justice inequality and more were things I organized against, but it had taken its toll on me. I stepped away from that and directed my energy into being the guy who was just grateful to be sober another day. When I realized I had a talent for endurance cycling, I became an evangelist about it to people who were interested, constantly talking people into attempting challenging bike rides of greater and greater distances. I met Wonder Woman at one of those rides.</p>\n<p>I finally learned how to make small talk. I adopted the role of a nurturer and started trying to make people comfortable, whether it was on a bike ride or at work when I went to help teachers and administrators with various computer problems. It was about this time that my grandchildren started entering the world, and I found that to soften me up a bit as well. I remember explicitly training myself to smile more.</p>\n<p>Today my problem is maintaining that friendly persona. It takes a lot of energy and sometimes I run out. \"What's the matter Lou? Why are you so quiet?\" is something I hear with regularity. There's nothing actually wrong. I just need some time to recharge my batteries and be still. By design, our home is a quiet place. It's relaxing. I have become an extrovert with introverted tendencies.</p>\n<p>When I look at people I know who seem to be always on their game, friendly and helpful by nature, I marvel at how they do it. I wonder if it even takes any effort on their part. I have a coworker who can talk to anyone and keep a calm demeanor throughout it all. He rarely complains and is always there to help when asked. Someone recently said that the two of us were alike, and I took it as a great compliment. Maybe I'm getting better at maintaining a friendly outside when my inside isn't feeling it. I hope so. It sure took long enough!\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

Then <a href=\"https://www.raycast.com/\">Raycast</a>\ncame along with it&#39;s floating notes feature, which is nice. It can be\nsummoned with a hot key. Then I found <a\nhref=\"https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/scrap-paper\">Scrap Paper</a>,\nwhich can also be called with a hotkey, syncs between computers and has\nan iOS version. You can hide the icon in the menu bar if you just want\nto use the hotkey. Furthermore, you can have the text window stay on top\nof all other windows, which is a feature I want. Finally, I saw <a\nhref=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/scratchpad/id6504040051\">Scratchpad</a>\non <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/macapps/\">r/MacApps</a> and I\nthought I&#39;d give it a try. It has everything Scrap Paper has, but can\nalso be launched from the dock. It adds</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Automatically creating clickable links from pasted URLS</li>\n<li>Control over font selection</li>\n<li>Text size adjustment</li>\n<li>Line spacing</li>\n<li>Smart quotes</li>\n<li>Smart Dashes</li>\n<li>Translucent background</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Because it&#39;s text, you get access to the writing tools, spelling and\ngrammar, substitutions, speech and the Mac Services menu. One awesome\nfeature is the ability to use Quicklook on a link, which opens a small\nwindow with a live view of the web page, similar to the Little Arc\nfeature in the Arc browser.</p>\n\n<p>Scratchpad offers scripting and shortcuts support. You can enter text\nonto Scratchpad from any app that can open a URL.</p>\n\n<p>There is a fully functional free trial of the macOS app available <a\nhref=\"https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/y4xzl0r4ifeml7ug3w603/Scratchpad-1.2.6-trial-1730450452.zip?rlkey=jfzs1u1iikns2dww21b9isw03&amp;raw=1\">here</a>.\nThe only limitation is a reminder to buy the app every 12 hours, and no\nautomatic updates.

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/vote_with_check_0.webp\" alt=\"Vote_with_check_0\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Question: Why do you have the politics you have today?</strong></p>\n<p>In real life, outside of my family and a couple of close friends, I rarely talk politics unless someone says something real backwards around me, in which case I speak up. I consider any endorsement of what passes for Republican policy to be backwards, so I'm not going to let anyone subject me to it. I don't go around preaching to anyone and all I want is the same treatment.</p>\n<p>That's the root of my politics right there. It's the golden rule. I want to live in a society where people treat other people the way they want to be treated. Republicans want a two tiered system where there is a definite advantage given to white, native born people. They want to explain away the disparity in educational achievement and the rates of incarceration by acting like minorities are stupid criminals instead of using our joint national resources to bring about a better system. If I were poor (again) I'd want to be treated with compassion, not scorn.</p>\n<p>Conservatives want a government that puts more money in their pocket and screw everybody who isn't like them. I want a government that provides for the common good.  don't believe in a government that foster's an elite class who get to skip paying taxes on their yachts and jets. I think that the effective tax rate for people who live off accumulated generational wealth should be at least as much as the people who clean their houses.</p>\n<p>In order to have the kind of country I want, the insane amount of money that gets funneled to defense corporations has to be drastically reduced. Our government has a vested interest in keeping people scared of terrorists, the Chinese, the Russians, Mexican drug lords. None of the money spent towards combatting that lengthens lives the way it would if it were spent on cancer research and improved medical care for everyone.</p>\n<p>I want to live in a country with educated people because I believe education to be important. I worked in schools for decades and I know how dedicated teachers are. Republicans have fostered a narrative that schools are failing and it isn't true. They use any excuse to avoid spending money on education, preferring to give tax cuts to those who already have the most money. They  want to give money to private schools that allow non-certified teachers to tell children that men and dinosaurs walked the earth together.</p>\n<p>I believe in science. Only a fool would look at the rapidly changing climate and think the best thing to do is drill more oil wells, but that is the policy Republicans want. I want to drink clean water and breath clean air and I don't want to be told how spending the money for those basic life giving necessities sin't good for the balance sheet of some billionaire.</p>\n<p>So there you have it. Those are my reasons. I don't think the Democratic party has the solution to all those problems, but they are a hell of a lot closer than the alternative. The two party system is terrible. There is too much money in politics. I hope we incrementally change the system to something that better serves more people, especially those that need it most.\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

When I decide I don't need something right now, I place it aside because you never know, I might need it later. Therein lies a slight problem. She looks at my stuff with a rapacious gleam in my eye, and from time to time I get a wee bit offended and protective of my stack of eight different sizes of jeans.</p>\n<p>One place I can hoard to my heart's content is on my computer. I have stacks of external hard drives full of, well, stuff - movies, music, 25-year-old website archives, multiple backups of photos. I also have accounts in iCloud, Google Drive, One Drive, Box and Dropbox with files on all of them. I have files I created in Microsoft Works, a program that was discontinued 15 years ago.</p>\n<p>When it comes to music, of course I have a subscription to one of those all-you-can-eat services, where I can listen to almost everything but the ripped CDs I bought at coffee houses and bars in the far distant past, but I worked hard to download all that music from Napster and I just don't want to let go of it.</p>\n<p>I've carried a smartphone around in my pocket since shortly after the iPhone was released. At work, I have always snapped pictures of bar code stickers we used to identify computers, the admin panel on printers, lights on switches and routers and all kinds of serial numbers. I have a career's worth of those photos that I only occasionally cull.</p>\n<p>The 2009 iMac I used as a Plex server to watch movies hasn't been plugged in for four years, yet it and all the movies I ripped back in the days when Netflix sent you DVDs in the mail are still located in our family room. When I hear one of my friends talking about their movie streaming setups, I have to stifle the urge to bring them a hard drive to fill up for me. We subscribe to EVERY channel and don't have time to watch what we are already paying for, and here I am thinking of ways to get more.</p>\n<p>I went through a collection of articles I'd saved today \"to read later\". It went back several years, and you could see my learning and interests patterns through different periods. I had dozens of saved YouTube videos on deadlifting and squatting from my power lifting days. There were tons of articles on stupid shit Trump did from 2105-2020 when I was building up my encyclopedic knowledge of his many faults. I had to trash a bunch of NYT and WaPo articles because I'm mad at them and canceled my subscriptions. I had automatically saved the entire blogging content of two of my favorite writers, <a href='https://birchtree.me/'>Matt Birchler</a> and <a href='https://heydingus.net/'>Jarrod Blundy</a> over the course of 2024 and had to eliminate all but the reference material from those prodigious writers.</p>\n<p>Of course, I have every tech guy's obligatory box of various cables and connectors. You just never know when you might need a 30-pin iPod cable or s-video adapter. FireWire might even stage a comeback. Stranger things have happened. I think there's even a Windows 7 laptop, sans power cord, around here somewhere that hasn't been booted up in 12 years. We have an extra iPad that I keep trying to think of a use for, and I am still holding on to my last Apple Watch, thinking I might make it my nighttime sleep recorder. I've been thinking about that for quite a while.</p>\n<p>Anyway, when Wonder Woman reads this, it may be my last blog post, so if y'all don't hear from me, you'll know she beat me to death for not getting rid of some of my very valuable personal possessions!\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

I had a list of over 100\nURLs that I needed to convert into a Chrome bookmark file for an import\nI was trying to do. This involves going out on the internet to get the\ntitle of each page and formatting an HTML link, complete with the\ncorrect header and footer.</p>\n\n<p>I tried:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Google Gemini Pro</li>\n<li>ChatGPT Web Interface</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.typingmind.com/\">Typing Mind</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>All three of these would generate between 40–50 lines of code and then\nquit. The last app I tried was <a\nhref=\"https://elephas.app/\">Elephas</a>. I used a very simple prompt,\n&quot;You are a web developer. You create web pages based on descriptions\ngiven to you.&quot; The reason Elephas succeeded where others failed was\nbecause of the choices it offers in AI models and the limits on them. It\nallows you to choose between:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>OpenAI (15 different choices)</li>\n<li>Groq</li>\n<li>Claude (7 different choices)</li>\n<li>Custom (local)</li>\n<li>Gemini (four different choices)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I selected gpt-4-turbo and was able to set the context tokens to a max\nof 100,000. It took a while to generate the file, but it finally did it\nin a usable format.</p>\n\n<p>Elephas has a variety of pricing plans for both subscriptions, starting\nat 8.99amonthforlimitedusageupto249 for a lifetime plan with unlimited\ntokens. I use the version that is available through Setapp with my own\nAPI keys for OpenAI and Gemini, for which the charges are negligible.</p>\n\n<p>Another interesting feature of Elephas is its ability to scan folders of\ndocuments on your local machine and incorporate that knowledge into its\nanswers. I have an <a\nhref=\"https://louplummer.lol/.obsidian.amerpie.lol\">Obsidian</a> vault\nwith 7K notes that it uses, as well as a 1GB directory of PDF files on\nvarious topics. It can also do all the standard things we&#39;ve come to\nexpect from AI apps:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Generate ideas</li>\n<li>Summarization</li>\n<li>Write articles (don't do this, it's lazy)</li>\n<li>Answer questions</li>\n<li>Reply to emails</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There is also an iOS version of Elephas.</p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Elephas Did What Others Wouldn't' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

Create a cumulative clipboard with <a href='https://www.popclip.app/'>Popclip</a></h2><p>Popclip is an app that does all sorts of things with text you select, from sending it to different apps, to formatting it, looking it up on Google, adding it to your calendar. One trick I learned it can do is to create a list from things you copy to your clipboard, so that you can copy 10 different things and then paste them all at once.</p>\n<h2 id=2-access-menu-bar-commands-from-anywhere-with-a-hrefhttpsfolivoraaibetter-touch-toola>2. Access Menu Bar Commands from Anywhere with <a href='https://folivora.ai/'>Better Touch Tool</a></h2><p><a href='https://folivora.ai/'>Better Touch Tool</a>is an app that lets you create an infinite amount of shortcuts and automations with your keyboard, mouse and trackpad. One of the things I set it up to do is add the menu bar commands to where ever my cursor is located when I type the ⌘ twice. I don't have to remember any shortcuts other than that one to use all the available commands in any program</p>\n<h2 id=3-use-a-hrefhttpswwwraycastcomraycasta-to-auto-quit-apps>3. Use <a href='https://www.raycast.com/'>Raycast</a> to Auto-Quit Apps</h2><p><a href='https://www.popclip.app/'>Raycast</a> is a free keyboard driven  app launcher similar to Spotlight, except it has superpowers and can replace all kinds of other programs on your computer, like your clipboard manager, your emoji picker and your window manager. One cool feature you can use on a case by case basis is to have it quit programs you aren't using automatically. Macs do a good job with memory management, but after a while your interface gets cluttered if you leave everything open. Just set Raycast to certain quit apps if they go 10 minutes without being used.\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

Eventually, everything falls apart. One just has to buy a home to see the truth in this. Trust me. Today, lots of people were disappointed that a well-liked Internet service, Omnivore, which allowed you to save articles to read later, subscribe to newsletters without using your personal email, and have some articles automatically archived, was turning off its servers on November 15. Some folks had just transitioned to using Omnivore, only to find that their efforts were now wasted. It was my favorite way to read a couple of my favorite writers, so I had to scramble to come up with an alternative.</p>\n<p>People have seen it happen time and again. Huge, popular websites and companies have just disappeared or changed so completely that they are no longer the same: MySpace, Digg, StumbleUpon, Epinions, the list is endless. We are used to it now. That's why I say people were disappointed rather than shocked.</p>\n<p>If you look at stats, the average length of time that people stay in a job continues to decrease. In 2024, it's a reality that in order to grow your wages, you often have to move from one employer to another. Pensions are very rare these days. Most of us have self-funded retirement; some are lucky to have an employer contribution, but our accounts are portable, unlike in the past. Even jobs that were once looked at as lifetime opportunities aren't the same anymore. I am a retired state employee, and one of the benefits I earned is lifetime health insurance. Too bad for new hires, though. The Republican state legislature took that away from future retirees, including teachers.</p>\n<p>I have seen landmark restaurants close their doors forever. It makes me really sad to think that my beloved Zorbas, the diner at the end of my street where I have eaten for 30 years, will be gone one day. I don't think that one set of my grandchildren has ever spent the night with us without going there for pancakes on a weekend morning. Things can be so central to our lives, and then one day they are just gone.</p>\n<p>Some great films from the early days of the movie industry weren't preserved, and the works of people like Rudolph Valentino, Clara Bow, and many others from the silent era will never be seen again. The military records of hundreds of thousands of World War Two veterans were burned in a fire at a VA records warehouse in the '60s, and the information on them is not retrievable. People think that the advent of computers means that data will last forever, but that's not true. CDs, floppy disks, and hard drives all have life spans, and if the data, whether it be pictures or music or books, isn't continually moved from one medium to another, one day it will be gone.</p>\n<p>I am of an age where my much-loved grandparents are long gone. Nobody likes to dwell on death, but we know that as we age, the frequency at which we confront it accelerates. Our relatives, our peers, our heroes, and idols begin to leave. I still find it hard to believe that I live in a world without people like Muhammed Ali and Hank Aaron, but I do.</p>\n<p>So, as trite as it may be, I'm using this reflection to encourage you (and myself) to savor what we have right now. Call your mom. Eat at your favorite restaurant. Read your favorite magazine. Watch your favorite TV show. Enjoy it all. One day it will all be gone.\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/fredrogers.webp\" alt=\"Fred Rogers\" /></p>\n<p>A long time ago, a friend of mine told me that in life, you find what you look for. I believe that to be true most of the time. I'm always on the lookout for nice people. Thinking about them is a tool I use in my personal gratitude practice, a daily exercise where I record three things I'm grateful for. I have been doing it for years. There's never been a time in my life when I couldn't find some folks with kindness in their heart. Even during the years when I worked as a prison guard, there were inmates who did kind things in a non-manipulative way. I used to drink coffee continually on that job. You could buy a packet of Taster's Choice in the canteen for a dime in those days. An old con who cleaned the area around my desk gave me some sage advice one day. \"Mr Plummer,\" he said, \"Don't ever put that coffee cup down and turn your back on it. These boys will spit in it if you do.\" It's been almost 40 years since he told me that and I still remember him for saving me from that indignity.</p>\n<p>During the years I worked as an IT tech in the school system, I would always be showered with gifts at Christmas. Teachers would bring me baked goods, iTunes gift cards, coupon books, CDs and more. With all that teaching involves, remembering the guy who comes around once in a while to look at your laptop takes some real effort. When I took a mid-career break to get married and go hiking for six months, many of those teachers send care packages to my wife and I with edible treats, socks, bug spray and other things from our wish list.</p>\n<p>People with demanding, public facing jobs who maintain their cool and make others feel welcome have a special gift. The wait staff at my favorite diner, even when they are slammed, still acknowledge their regulars. They are still nice and patient with kids. They take a minute to crack jokes and to make fun of me for always ordering the same thing.</p>\n<p>So many of the tools I've learned to love on my computer are apps that some developer has made and given away for free. Everything I know about creating a blog is a result of freely distributed guides and tutorials.  The number of letters I've gotten from complete strangers on the Internet to thank me for something or to encourage me or to praise me is just astounding. People will go out of their way just to make someone else feel good and I think that is awesome. Yes, I have also experienced some meanness online but it's overshadowed by kindness.</p>\n<p>I think often about some of the giants I have know who dedicated their lives to the social justice movement. I know men and women who worked in the deep south during the Civil Rights era at great danger to themselves. I know organizers who survived the 1979 Greensboro Massacre who are still committed to the cause of helping poor people. I know union workers who've left home to travel to other areas to help organize workers so that they might enjoy the same benefits. I know soldiers who, sickened by war, laid down their rifles to speak out to try and stop the senseless killing that our government asked them to do in the nebulous name of freedom.</p>\n<p>Look for kind people today. Better yet, be kind. Get your name added to someone's gratitude list.\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

One thing it doesn&#39;t do is\ncontrol items that launch in the background.</p>\n\n<p>Today I found an app that does a good job with that aspect of app\nmanagement. Coincidentally, it&#39;s also called <a\nhref=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/startup-manager/id1296723195?mt=12\">Startup\nManager</a>, but it&#39;s a totally different app by a different developer,\nSystweak Software (Shrishail Rana). Where it shines is in telling you\nall the apps that you have installed that have background processes,\neven if they are disabled. In the system settings for macOS, some\nbackground processes are identified by the name of the developer rather\nthan the name of the app, making it confusing to sort out what you are\ntrying to control. Startup Manager identifies all the processes using\nthe name of the associated app.</p>\n\n<p>The recently updated app (September 2024) provides information on\nbrowser extensions, Kernel extensions, Launch items, Library inserts,\nLogin items, and Spotlight importers. In the login items, launch items\nand browser plugins categories you can enable/disable each item, delete\nit, get information about it and see where it&#39;s located in the Finder.</p>\n\n<p>By default, Apple&#39;s applications are not shown, but you can toggle them\non if desired.</p>\n\n<p>Startup manager is free and can ve downloaded in the <a\nhref=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/startup-manager/id1296723195?mt=12\">Mac\nApp Store.</a><br /></p>\n\n<figure class=\"attachment attachment--preview flex-col justify-center attachment--jpg\">\n      <img class=\"lightbox--image\" srcset=\"https://scribbles.page/rails/active_storage/representations/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBbXFtIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--e10dec0eaf20ebc68aa9d23563fcf5c6ef6a00c4/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDRG9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJYW5CbkJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFJQUVHa0NBQXc2Q25OaGRtVnlld2M2Q25OMGNtbHdWRG9NY1hWaGJHbDBlV2xrIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJ2YXJpYXRpb24ifX0=--95bb9764b8481bddaaffec4af57d9e494bae5163/CleanShot%202024-10-28%20at%2018.22.00@2x.jpg 2x\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Apple System Setting Interface\" src=\"https://scribbles.page/rails/active_storage/representations/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBbXFtIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--e10dec0eaf20ebc68aa9d23563fcf5c6ef6a00c4/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDRG9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJYW5CbkJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFJQUNHa0NBQVk2Q25OaGRtVnlld2M2Q25OMGNtbHdWRG9NY1hWaGJHbDBlV2xrIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJ2YXJpYXRpb24ifX0=--daf4078a1aefa3c961be2c7b8fbe4a74a2641c0c/CleanShot%202024-10-28%20at%2018.22.00@2x.jpg\" />\n    <figcaption class=\"attachment__caption text-center\">\n      Apple System Setting Interface\n    </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=A Different App for Managing Background Items' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/life-cycle.webp\" alt=\"Silhouettes depict stages of human life: a baby lying, a toddler crawling, a child walking, a teenager striding, an adult strolling, and an elder using a cane, against a plain background.\" /></p>\n<p>I'm turning 60 in a few months and though I wouldn't say it's messing with my head in any kind of negative way, it has prompted me to think about aging and mortality more than I have in the past. It's so weird to be getting ready to start my seventh decade on earth while simultaneously being able to recall events from the past as if they happened yesterday. In some ways, it is almost inconceivable that high school happened 40+ years ago. I had dinner with my brother (58) and sister (56) the other night along with my mother (77) and we were recalling events from growing up as if they just happened last week.</p>\n<p>I've been going gray for years. Not only that, but I wear a full beard and it is 100% white. Wonder Woman told me today that one of our grandkids said to her recently, \"Nana you might be old, but at least you're not as old as Papa.\" For the record, we are less than two years apart. Still, there has been more than one occasion when we've eaten together, and they've extended a senior discount to me (I'm not old enough) and not to her. Sometimes I feel like I'm in a Sci-fi novel, married to an immortal who doesn't age. She was furious when Kamala Harris first named Tim Walz as her running mate because she thought he was just another old white man. Once she found out that Kamala and Tim are are the same age that he is cool AF, she calmed down.</p>\n<p>I charged full steam ahead through my 40s and early 50s, hiking the Appalachian Trail and completing 83 century rides on my bicycle. I thought I'd be going like that for decades until arthritis brought me to a screeching halt and I had to have both knees replaced. Plenty of people go on to have very active lives after that surgery, so there is still hope that I'll get some of that mojo back. My mom walked across England and hiked the Camino de Santiago in Spain in her 70s.</p>\n<p>Our oldest grandchildren have graduated from high school now. It won't be long before we are great-grandparents. It's funny because all of my siblings, none of whom got married or had kids early like me, all have children the same ages as my grandchildren. I grumbled for years that I didn't like kids, but it was all a facade. I worked in primary and elementary schools for two decades, and being a grandparent has been one of the best experiences of my life.</p>\n<p>I'm trying to be OK with the fact that I don't feel like my time on earth is unlimited like I have for most of my life. Not being a religious person, there are no thoughts of an afterlife. Every time I do something unhealthy, I immediately have the thought that I'm robbing myself of time. I wish I could say that I am them immediately motivated to then eat some spinach and power walk around the block, but so far that has not been the effect.</p>\n<p>I have got to say that I enjoy having been around enough to be retired from my career job. It's cool going to work these days because I want to, not because I have to. I could stop at any time. That's pretty empowering. It makes the crappy days that inevitably happen at work more bearable. I'm not even the oldest person in my office. Our database manager is three years my senior, and she takes no shit from anyone. She's my role model.</p>\n<p>I can accept my eyes getting weaker and my gait getting slower. As far as I can tell, my mind isn't slipping yet. Both my parents are still alive, so family history indicates that I probably have quite a few years left. I hope so. There is so much more to write about.\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

I was a wee bit busy this weekend being a supportive husband and was away from my computer)</p>\n<p>I often make the comment on Reddit or Mastodon that Obsidian, a cross-platform note-taking application, is my favorite piece of software since Netscape Navigator 2, the browser that practically everyone used when we transitioned from AOL and CompuServe to the real Internet back in the 90s. Back then, we discovered new and interesting web pages daily. The Internet was full of hastily constructed and esoteric material, and it all seemed so magical. For our whole lives, we'd had to wait until 10 past the hour for the radio to give us a weather forecast, and now we could use this marvelous piece of software to go to weather.com whenever we were curious. It was revolutionary and amazing, and it took a while to get used to.</p>\n<p>Eventually we did get used to it, along with all the other marvels over the past nearly 30 years. I find myself quite jaded sometimes. The computer I carry in my pocket can do almost anything, and I'm still referring to it as a phone, the same name I used for the hard-wired wall mounted rotary dialed device at my grandmother's house. I no longer marvel at being able to do my Christmas shopping from my couch or following a baseball game pitch by pitch, knowing the speed of every thrown ball and the batting average of every hitter right up to that at bat.</p>\n<p>I experienced an Internet revival late last year. After an aborted attempt to retire early, I'd lost interest in keeping up with technology. I quit following the news, stopped downloading software and spent hours scrolling trash subreddits like \"Am I the Asshole\". Out of desperation, I went back to work to have something to do. Even though I went back into the IT field, I was still ambivalent. Instead of being on a Mac like I was used to, I was assigned a slow old Dell full of Microsoft software. It did not spark joy. Then one day I picked up my old iPad and for some reason launched my RSS reader. Many of the blog feeds were years old and dead, but some were still active. I started reading them, first from boredom and then with interest. People were talking about apps I'd never heard of. I cracked open my MacBook and started downloading updates for the OS and the hundreds of apps I'd collected over the years. It took a while.</p>\n<p>A British blogger, Robb Knight, had <a href='https://defaults.rknight.me/'>created a page where people were listing their default apps</a> in all kinds of categories. I wanted to get on the fun. I'd been working in the Apple/Mac/iOS space since the late 90s and except for the short break after retirement, I'd always been fascinated by software. In order to get added to Robb's site, <a href='https://obsidian.amerpie.lol/'>I had to start a blog</a>. I signed up at <a href='http://micro.blog/'>Micro.blog</a>, registered a domain and started writing. One app I saw mentioned over and over that I'd never used was Obsidian. It's free to download, and you can use it all you want without paying a dime unless you want to take advantage of their sync service, something I did a little later.</p>\n<p>I documented my learning process in Obsidian as it progressed. I'd download a plugin, watch a YouTube video, configure my setup, use it for a few days and then <a href='https://amerpie.lol/2024/03/06/my-dataview-use.html'>write a post for my blog</a>. I'd cross post it on Reddit and use a hashtag on Mastodon. I went for months living and breathing Obsidian. I started doing all my writing in it. I pimped out <a href='https://amerpie.lol/2024/03/29/my-daily-note.html'>the template for my daily note</a>, incorporating more and more of my life into it. I <a href='https://amerpie.lol/2024/02/04/how-to-send.html'>integrated key email messages</a> via IFTTT, Dropbox and Hazel. I <a href='https://amerpie.lol/2024/03/17/my-bookmark-workflow.html'>synced my bookmarks</a> from Raindrop.io. I started using Omnivore as my read it later service simply because <a href='https://amerpie.lol/2024/01/27/the-omnivore-to.html'>it automatically imports into Obsidian</a>. I started <a href='https://github.com/cyclelou/Amerpie'>my first GitHub repository</a> to share 500 Markdown notes containing my quotes collection. I managed to get Obsidian to do every single thing I'd once used Evernote for.</p>\n<p>Because of Obsidian, I've been able to learn to blog in the 21st century. I have four different blogs on three different platforms. I've got good notes and records and tens of thousands of words of web posts in my vault. Although I still write about the app occasionally, I've moved on to <a href='https://apps.louplummer.lol/'>writing reviews of other software</a> and even into <a href='https://louplummer.lol/'>non-technical writing</a>. It's amazing that something as simple as a plain text editor at its core has been at the center of my tech and real-life revival. It is so powerful and so extensible that it almost defies belief. The community around the app is generally helpful, supportive, curious and open. I've even interacted with the CEO of the company on social media.</p>\n<p>So, to the folks in whatever Bat Cave Obsidian is developed in, thank you for making such a wonderful tool. I owe you one.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

I did not limit myself to just the comics. I thought Dear Abby was fascinating and I always read the headlines on the front page. In North Carolina in the 1970s an infamous civil rights case was often featured. The Wilmington 10 was the name given to eight high school students, a minister from the United Church of Christ and an anti-poverty worker who had been caught up when the men were arrested for arson, following a bombing during racial unrest in the coastal town of Wilmington. The case was considered by many to be a travesty of justice from the very beginning. The convictions were based on eyewitness testimony from a mentally ill man who recanted during cross-examination and was banished from the courtroom. The other witness was given a motorcycle for his testimony. He too, later recanted.</p>\n<p>when the Soviet Union was accused by the United States of human rights violations, the Soviets used the Wilmington 10 as an example of American hypocrisy. After serving nearly a decade in prison, all of the convictions were overturned, and the state declined to re-prosecute. In 2013, over 40 years after their initial convictions, the Wilmington 10 were granted pardons by the governor of North Carolina, although four of them had already passed away.

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/ww2.webp\" alt=\"ww2\" /></p>\n<p>At 8:00 AM Saturday morning, Wonder Woman and about 70 others will begin running a 2.2-mile course over and over for 24 straight hours. Whoever covers the most distance in that time period will be declared the winner. Those completing 50k, 50 miles, 100k, 75 miles, and 100 miles will receive special awards. Some races are entrepreneurial money-making events for the organizers. Ironman, the titular sponsor of triathlons, is a for-profit company. The race Wonder Woman is in is a fundraiser. The money raised goes to an organization in the greater Williamsburg, VA area called The Arc. This is a wonderful inclusive organization offering programs to adults with developmental and intellectual disabilities.</p>\n<p>The name of the race is The Greensprings 24. The start/finish line and crew area (I'm crew) is at Jamestown High School. If you want to follow her, you can do it <a href='https://my.raceresult.com/314559/'>here.</a> Her race number is 204, and her actual name is Carol Plummer.</p>\n<p>I'll be set up in a pop-up off to the side with her supplies. I'll be in charge of filling bottles with both water and a liquid nutrition product called Tailwind. She has prepared packets of sports nutrition products that she will pick up every five laps or so. I have a small backpacking stove to heat up some real food for her to wolf down later in the day and through the night. It consists of things like plain white potatoes and soup. I'll be making coffee for us both.</p>\n<p>Today has been kind of ritualistic. We live about four hours away, so we had to travel and check into a hotel. She's stayed off her feet for the most part, although I did have to talk her out of going out and doing tourist things today. She has a more restless nature than I do! It's important that she stays extra hydrated today and that she eats some extra carbs. Her favorite pre-ultramarathon meal is pho, the Vietnamese rice noodle soup made with a salty and savory beef broth. She got into bed at 5:30 to read and hopefully doze off early. We will sleep as late as we can tomorrow before driving the 15 minutes to the racecourse in time to get the crew area set up.</p>\n<p>My duties will be pretty minimal. I'm mostly there as a cheerleader and motivator. If she gets blisters, I'll play medic, and as she gets progressively more tired, I'll help her with socks and shoe changes. I'll probably get yelled at a time or two. Ultramarathon runners are known for being grouchy crybabies sometimes because it's a terribly stressful sport. I'm experienced enough to let the abuse roll off. If blowing up at me makes her feel better, she's welcome to call me names any time. I admire her not just for competing in these events but also for all the training and disciplined training, eating, and sleeping she does on top of working an important job full-time, being a wife, a mom, and a grandmother. I don't call her Wonder Woman for nothing!</p>\n<p>When the race is over, we will have to pack the car and drive back to the hotel. We've arranged a late checkout so we can both get some sleep before driving home and going back to work on Monday.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

Over the next 15 years my cohort, smaller than the one that preceded it and the one that followed it (Millenials), began to reap the meager rewards our parents bequeathed us, single-parent families, careers as latch-key kids, run away inflation and coming of age with Reagan in the White House making it easy on rich folks and kicking off the decline of the middle class by breaking unions and kicking income inequality into high gear.</p>\n<p>The oldest Gen X-ers are only five years from retirement. Everything seems to have changed for us. We bought records we traded in for tapes that we traded in for CDs before we downloaded MP3s that we stopped listening to when we had to start paying a subscription fee to listen to music. After graduating from high school, I supported a wife and a baby by cooking at a Shoney's and serving in the National Guard one weekend a month. By the time my youngest reached maturity, two adults working full time at entry level jobs could barely make ends meet.</p>\n<p>We experienced a few cool things, like getting to watch MTV when they played music video. We've had some great music. We got to transition out of a world that worried about nuclear holocausts. Unfortunately we got to see AIDS put in an end to the free love we thought we were going to get.

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/p070wbmx-resized.webp\" alt=\"The Night Watch\" /></p>\n<p>Back in the days when people still bought encyclopedias, my parents were confronted by an especially good salesman who sold them not only a full set of the Book of Knowledge but also a collection of classic literature. When I was in elementary school, I tackled many of those books because I thought they sounded interesting. I mean, Gulliver's Travels was about little people, and Pilgrim's Progress was about (I thought) American pioneers. I plowed through the books with as much understanding as I could muster at that age, and can today truly state that I've read them. The problem is that it's been years since I felt any urge to approach that kind of book. When I see people reading The Scarlet Letter or Dante, I'm in awe. I would feel like I was back in high school senior English if I picked up one of those books. I'm even inherently suspicious when an enthusiastic reviewer claims that a novel in one of the genres I like these days—English detective novels, science fiction, military fiction—rises to the level of literature.</p>\n<p>I'm generally OK with my lack of formal education. I managed to learn enough on my own to support myself through retirement. I can talk to anybody and don't suffer from low self-esteem (quite the opposite if you ask Wonder Woman). I just regret not being exposed to classes like music appreciation and art appreciation. I enjoy some classical music. I've listened to Vivaldi enough that I can generally recognize his compositions, but I don't have any background in theory. Opera is a mystery, and I've only got a rudimentary knowledge of the development of jazz, although I do have a good collection of Miles Davis and John Coltrane.</p>\n<p>When it comes to art, well, I've been to one exhibition—Norman Rockwell. I thoroughly enjoyed it, but I know that hardly qualifies me as a connoisseur. I can name famous artists and tell a Rothko from a Jackson Pollock, but I still feel under-qualified. My son takes trips to Boston and New York just to visit art museums. Considerable space in his tiny Austin bungalow is given over to his collection of art books, and the walls are covered in originals he's purchased at galleries. My walls are covered in pictures of my grandkids and Wonder Woman's photography, which is admittedly pretty arty.</p>\n<p>I rarely like any film that wins the Best Picture award from the Academy. In fact, I am still mad at myself for sitting through The English Patient all those years ago. It's not that I'm a fan of superhero movies—not that there is anything wrong with them—I just seem to lack the gene that lets people discern symbolism in films. I'm very much an on-the-surface kind of guy. My most common reaction to reviews of arty movies is WTF?</p>\n<p>At this point in my life, I'm not likely to summon the energy to improve on any of this. I've learned to live with my shortcomings in appreciating things the way the more cultured folks do. I feel proud of myself for reading the occasional book of poetry (full disclosure: my son buys them for me) and for reading The New Yorker, Harper's, and The Atlantic. That will have to do, I suppose.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/leroy.webp\" alt=\"leroy\" /></p>\n<p>For one reason or another, I've taken some kind of medication on a daily basis for almost forty years. I am an expert at swallowing pills. I'd hate to estimate how many I've taken over the years. Despite the attempts by my insurance company to strong-arm me into using a mail-order pharmacy, I stubbornly cling to a locally owned one that I lucked into by being hard to get along with.</p>\n<p>I used to use various big box pharmacies. One thing I quickly learned by doing that was that the people there do not care about you. You might occasionally run into someone with a heart for people, but by and large, the pharmacists and techs there don't form relationships, and they stop seeing their customers as human beings after a while. That's been my experience. They will tell you to come back tomorrow in a minute. They will tell you that counting your own meds after they short you is your responsibility. Furthermore, they won't make the extra effort to deal with frustrating insurance companies. I pretty much would rather die a thousand deaths than deal with one.</p>\n<p>Luckily, a local pharmacist with good business sense saw an opportunity to draw business away from them by starting his own pharmacy in a good location. He hired nice, competent people, and most of the time, you could go in there with a prescription in hand and walk out within 15 minutes with your medicine. It was glorious. Unfortunately, he had two giant TVs right behind the cash register tuned in at all times to Fox News. I was in there when they were covering a story about poor people trapped in a flood after a hurricane. The owner of the pharmacy was ranting that it was all their own fault for not leaving. I disgustedly asked him if he thought maybe they should have just driven their Maserati out of town or something.</p>\n<p>I went home, went to the pharmacy's Facebook page, and left a scathing review, where I said they had good service but bad politics, and they weren't getting any more of my money as a result. I resigned myself to living in Big Box Hell. Some period after that, I got a message through Facebook from a name I didn't recognize. The writer, first name LeRoy, told me that he'd been a partner in the pharmacy but that he was leaving to go out on his own. He let me know that there would be no giant TVs playing Fox News in his new business and asked me to give him a chance, so I did.</p>\n<p>These days, when I go to a doctor's visit for med refills, LeRoy has them filled before I can get out of the parking lot. If I have a question or an issue about one of my prescriptions, I can message him via Facebook or text him to get an answer or a refill. He's fought every insurance battle that's faced me for a decade. When big pharma jacked up the price of one of my meds by 400%, LeRoy figured out how to get me a better price. If I'm late picking up a refill, he doesn't put my meds back on the shelf and yell at me on my next visit; he just holds on to them for me, secure in the knowledge that I will get there eventually.</p>\n<p>We are social media friends, and both of us are big baseball fans. I've followed his son's career from club ball through our local high school and summer ball. He now plays for the university where I work, which has one of the nation's best NCAA D3 baseball programs and a legendary coach. LeRoy's wife is a nurse practitioner with her own clinic, and she's treated me for everything from multi-day hiccups to a sliced finger.</p>\n<p>In a day and age where so many businesses seem as though they exist only to extract money from you, LeRoy and his pharmacy are a total exception. He gives unfailingly polite service and always makes me feel welcome and cared for. He inquires about my wife, asks about my job, and tells me about his last baseball trip. Everyone should be so lucky.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

I like chicken sandwiches OK, but I prefer the ones from Bojangles. Hell, I eat the ones they sell in gas stations. Every Chick-fil-A I come across is always super crowded. They have a reputation for dealing well with crowds, but you have to go be part of a crowd to find out if that's true. No thanks.</p>\n<p>The biggest reason I don't eat there though is their reputation for being homophobic. Someone in my area had a Chik-fil-A Support Day a couple of years ago and lots of ostentatious Christians that I know made a big deal out of going their and posting it on social media just in case they hadn't done enough in their lives to be shitty to  LGBT people.</p>\n<p>In doing some basic research for this post, I found that the hate-chicken people quit giving money to homophobic organizations a few years ago. The owner doesn't even use his personal fortune that way any more. Most people think the motivation behind that is to stave off boycotts and bad press and they are probably right. Right-wing organizations accused Chik-fil-A of caving the the Gay Agenda, if you can believe that.</p>\n<p>I know some principled leftists who patronize them now, partially because out of all the fast food chains, they offer more for people with celiacs.

You could use HTML to dress up what you wrote, so there was a small but satisfying thrill in learning how to be good at that. As usual, they had an off-topic category too, where you could write about whatever you wanted, and I contributed there all the time. People could follow you and send you private messages. I eventually outgrew it, but I tried to find a guy from there recently, after 27 years, and I succeeded because he's still using the same unique username.</p>\n<p>When I had a Geocities website, part of it was dedicated to Vietnam veterans and their kids. I corresponded with quite a few men and women who were eager to have someone to talk with about their experiences. I live near a giant army base, so all the vets I know have comrades-in-arms everywhere they go, but the 18-year-old who got drafted from Iowa in 1967 and did his year in hell didn't always have that, and I was glad to hear them out, publish their stories, and generally just be as supportive as I could.</p>\n<p>I was in some great bicycling forums around the turn of the century, one of which still sends me birthday greetings every year. I went as far as Georgia to meet folks from there for an organized ride.</p>\n<p>For a few years, believe it or not, I took part in the local newspaper's community forum, which was mostly a cesspool of name-calling and ad hominem attacks on liberals. I'd write outrageously provocative stuff about W. Bush and his wars just to stir up the flag wavers. They doxed me regularly, and the woman I was married to absolutely hated me going on there. After a while, it wasn't fun anymore, so I stopped.</p>\n<p>When I hiked the Appalachian Trail, I kept <a href='http://www.trailjournals.com/leftyandhush/'>an online journal</a> every single day and posted to a website called Trail Journals. As a result, I had people up and down the East Coast who wrote to us and visited us on the trail. It wasn't unusual to meet trail groupies who knew all kinds of our fellow hikers from reading their journals. More than a decade later, I am still in touch with people I first met through that journal.</p>\n<p>Then we enter the long dark winter of the soul—Facebook was all there was. I never really used Twitter for anything other than news, so I didn't find much social about it. <a href='https://louplummer.lol/why-im-still-on-facebook/'>My Facebook experience is much the same as many folks</a>. In 2008, it was a place to keep up with friends and family and to reconnect with people from the past. Today, it's the same toxic hellscape for me as it is for everyone else. I mostly stay there to see pictures of my grandkids. In 2017, I had a viral post that caused me to get literally thousands of friend requests, many of which I accepted for the hell of it. I met plenty of cool people, including a friend I eventually met in Derry, Northern Ireland.</p>\n<p>My experience on the IndieWeb since I joined <a href='https://amerpie.lol'>micro.blog</a> in January has been my favorite experience out of all of them. In 10 months, I've posted more on <a href='https://social.lol/@amerpie'>Mastodon</a> than I did on Twitter in 15 years. I have three accounts on different servers. I closed my Twitter account too, not wanting to send any traffic to what is essentially the Nazi Bar of the Internet. I am a happy customer of <a href='https://linkage.lol/omglol-is-the-best-thing-on-the-internet/'>OMG.LOL</a>, <a href='https://patreon.com/500social'>500.social</a>, and <a href='https://onephoto.club'>Onephoto.club</a>. Aside from Micro.blog, I also use <a href='https://scribbles.page'>Scribbles</a> and <a href='https://bearblog.dev/'>BearBlog.</a></p>\n<p>I have accounts on Instagram, Threads, BlueSky, Pinterest, Nostr, Pixelfed, Farcaster, and Tumblr, but I use them mostly to syndicate what I write on my blogs.</p>\n<p>I do love Reddit, where I've <a href='https://www.reddit.com/user/amerpie/'>had an account for nearly 19 years</a>, despite its checkered past. Syndicating <a href='https://apps.louplummer.lol'>AppAddict</a> there has driven lots of traffic to my website. Earlier this year, I volunteered to become a moderator of <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/'>r/macOS</a>, a subreddit with over 300K members. That's been interesting. I get a chance to help out newbies and to stamp out some toxicity, so what it lacks in actual fun, it makes up in satisfaction.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

This can be\nproblematic during your work day if you need the full system resources\nof your computer, but it has decided to start copying a bunch of files\nto your backup. The venerable utility, Time Machine Editor, a free app\nby developer Thomas Clement is the solution to this problem. To use TME,\nyou first need to go into Time Machine options in System Settings and\nset your backups to &quot;Manually.&quot; Download and install TME from <a\nhref=\"https://tclementdev.com/timemachineeditor/\">the developers&#39;s\nwebsite</a> or through Homebrew.</p>\n\n<pre>brew install --cask timemachineeditor</pre>\n\n<p>Once installed, you can choose any of several options to schedule Time\nMachine backups. On my work iMac, I chose to stop the backups between\n8am and 5pm when I am using the computer but to continue hourly backups\nafter that. To be on the safe side, TME allows you to create local disk\nsnapshots during the time you are not writing to your backup disk. They\nare very fast to make, and provide additional restoration points. Since\nthey are local, they do not protect against a disk crash but can be\nuseful if the machine goes away from the backup disk for a while.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve used this utility for more than a decade, and it&#39;s never let me\ndown.</p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Good Old Time Machine Editor - A Useful Free Utility' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

Although I am partial to the mountains, there is something to be said for visiting the colonial historical sites closer to the coast. Whether it's Jamestown, one of the first settlements in the new world, Yorktown, site of the American victory in the Revolutionary War or the extensive and richly restored town of Colonial Williamsburg, you won't be disappointed. Thankfully, the exhibits in Williamsburg include ones dedicated to Native American and African American history. It's quite an experience to walk the streets and see people in colonial dress, gardening with period tools and making the same type of crafts that were common in the 1700s. It's a fun and affordable way to spend  a day.  If you are a cyclist, bring your bike. The 23-mile Colonial Parkway between Yorktown and Jamestown is a road you'll want to add to the miles you've traveled while pedaling.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.colonialwilliamsburg.org/learn/about-colonial-williamsburg/history/'>History of Colonial Williamsburg</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://www.nps.gov/colo/parkway.htm'>Colonial Parkway - Colonial National Historical Park (U.S. National Park Service)</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://historicjamestowne.org/visit/plan-your-visit/'>Plan Your Visit | Historic Jamestowne</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://www.nps.gov/york/planyourvisit/index.htm'>Plan Your Visit - Yorktown Battlefield Part of Colonial National Historical Park (U.S. National Park Service)</a>\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/bbdb8f67-6ccc-4fd1-9155-b1969c01577a_1_105_c.webp\" alt=\"Maine Lobster\" /></p>\n<p>The year Wonder Woman and I hiked the Appalachian Trail, we were away from home for 156 days, from early May to mid-October. At the beginning of our journey, I weighed around 230 pounds. By the end, I had dropped to 180 pounds and was wearing medium-sized clothes for the first time since high school. For most long-distance hikers, the two overriding feelings are ravenous hunger and fatigue. The trail involves over 400,000 feet of climbing, stretching from Maine to Georgia and covering just shy of 2,200 miles. It’s almost impossible for hikers to carry enough food to sustain their weight, though some manage better than others for physiological reasons I can’t quite grasp.</p>\n<p>In preparation for our hike, we spent a lot of time packing boxes of food for my daughter and son-in-law to mail to us at various hostels, outfitters, and general delivery post offices along the way. We bought cases of oatmeal, Pop-Tarts, energy bars, corn chips, and other pre-made food. We also dehydrated large quantities of sweet potatoes, black beans, and several London broils to make beef jerky. Since Wonder Woman has celiac disease and can’t eat wheat, we were concerned about finding adequate food for her along the trail. In hindsight, we shouldn’t have worried—or prepared so much food. We ended up giving away large portions of it when it became monotonous. To our surprise, finding gluten-free food wasn’t as challenging as we had anticipated.</p>\n<p>A guy my size, carrying a 25-pound backpack and climbing mountains all day in hot weather, can burn upwards of 5,000 calories a day if he hikes long enough. We typically woke up around 5:00 AM to eat and pack our gear. My breakfast usually consisted of two large honeybuns thickly covered with peanut butter or Nutella. Occasionally, I’d indulge in a bagel. I drank instant coffee boiled over the beer can alcohol stove I packed. While hiking, I’d consume a Snickers bar or a couple of Nature Valley granola bars every hour. I also ate quite a few Clif bars, but I found they tasted progressively worse the more I had.</p>\n<p>For lunch and dinner, I often wrapped my meals in a big flour tortilla. My fillings included tuna, cheese from a block I carried, dried beef or Slim Jims, hot sauce, and maybe some crumbled Fritos. I always had a second tortilla with peanut butter. For dessert, I enjoyed candy, usually Whoppers or dark chocolate. I also devoured countless bags of pork rinds—they weigh almost nothing and pack a whopping 900 calories per bag. Sometimes I’d eat a couple of family packs of instant mashed potatoes or instant rice or pasta dishes from Lipton. I’m proud to say that, unlike most of my fellow hikers, I didn’t eat any ramen noodles. I like them just fine, but they simply didn’t appeal to me at the time. After returning home, I discovered that I had royally messed up my electrolyte balance by not getting enough sodium, so maybe some ramen would have been a good idea after all.</p>\n<p>Hiker hunger is truly on display at restaurants in the towns along the trail. Every few days, hikers need to find a place to buy supplies, wash their clothes, and grab a shower. However, they don’t do any of that until they’ve filled their bellies at whatever establishment they can find. There were times when I’d order a meal, quickly finish it, and then order a second meal before feeling even slightly full.\nAlongside the food, I’d drink entire pitchers of Coke, or, when we were in the South, sweet iced tea. We were always on the lookout for any AYCE (all you can eat) places, although I was asked to leave a Chinese buffet in Pittsfield, MA, after my sixth plate. In New Jersey, there’s a stretch of trail that allows you to hit quite a few delis in a short span, and I certainly took advantage of that. In New England, I savored a delicacy we don’t have in North Carolina: gigantic full-belly clams. Of course, in Maine, I enjoyed fresh lobster during a memorable meal in Millinocket, the town near the northern terminus of Mount Katahdin.</p>\n<p>Most of the weight I lost came back within a year. To this day, I haven’t had another Snickers bar, and I went a decade without eating a honeybun. I’m not a Nutella fan anymore, although I still enjoy a fair amount of peanut butter. Whenever we travel to trail towns during hiking season, I always nudge Wonder Woman if I see a hiker come in, so we can watch them order the prodigious amount of food they typically get. It brings back such fond memories.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

If you use Google Chrome (and most of you do), your ad-blocking capabilities have been seriously dampened by Google's decision to implement new standards for browser extensions. Don't panic though. There is a solution that is free and will make your computer more private and your browsing faster. That solution is NextDNS, a free service that blocks ads and malware from ever loading on your computer in the first place. If you set this up, you can even stop whole domains from ever loading. Imagine having Twitter never polluting your presence ever again.

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/vote.webp\" alt=\"Voting Sign\" /></p>\n<p>In North Carolina, where I live, early voted started this week. On the first day, we set a record for voter turnout. Even in the western portions of the state where a recent hurricane destroyed roads and where many people still don't have power, the number of people who turned out exceeded the numbers from four years ago when conditions were not impeded. Wonder Woman and I always try to vote early, partly to get it out of the way and partly out of excitement.</p>\n<p>This year we went to a recreation center located about three miles from our house. My kids went to dances there when they were in school, and I have taken my grandchildren there many times to play on the playground. Today I went to defend democracy from the fascists trying to take over my country. Donald Trump recently called people like me \"radical left lunatics\" and said we are \"the enemy within.\"</p>\n<p>We were met by campaign volunteers from various candidates, who are allowed to approach voters as long as they stay 50 feet or more from the front doors. I gratefully accepted a voter guide from a guy who had a list of all the Democratic candidates and offered polite \"no, thank yous\" to everyone else who wanted to hand me literature. I usually try to research all the obscure races ahead of time, but I was glad to have the guide nonetheless. We used to be able to do straight party voting here, but the Republicans eliminated it because they thought it would help them.</p>\n<p>Most of the people in line were younger and there were lots of POC. One dumb ass showed up in full Trump rally regalia and people were staring daggers at him. I wanted to catch his eye and mouth \"I'm canceling your vote\" but he kept staring at the floor, too embarrassed, I hope to feel like he could hold his head up amongst his perceived enemies. In my mind, whenever I am in line to vote, the happy people are always Democrats and the sour pusses are Republicans. Unfortunately, 60% of white men are probably going to vote for Trump, citing many different reasons but the primary one, I am convinced is to perpetuate white supremacy. Yeah, screw that. Not this white guy.</p>\n<p>We had one extremely stupid constitutional amendment to vote on, one that would make excluding everyone under the age of 18 who isn't a US citizen from voting. If you thought there was already a law in place that did that, you would be right, but you underestimate the idiocy of the Republican Party who wants to plant the idea in their pitiful voter's heads that the Democrats are getting ready to allow children and illegal immigrants to cancel Bubba's vote. These people are pitiful.</p>\n<p>I will be glad when the election is settled. I expect there to be all kinds of controversy and dirty tricks from the other side. Another insurrection is certainly a possibility. They are losers but they don't lose gracefully.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

For offsite data storage, I recently discovered <a\nhref=\"https://duplicati.com/\">Duplicati</a>, a free, open-source backup\nprogram that uses encryption to securely store your data on various\ncloud services, local drives, or remote servers. It offers flexible\nscheduling, versioning, and incremental backups for reliable data\nprotection.</p>\n\n<p>The free plan covers up to five computers. I downloaded and installed\nthe client. It launches a web interface that walks you through setting\nup you first backup. To test it, I elected to create a backup of my\nObsidian vault using my free Dropbox account as the file storage\ndestination. I elected to back the files up every 24 hours and it has\nbeen running every day at exactly the time I selected. </p>\n\n<p>Duplicati also works with Google Drive, One Drive and Box as well as\nAzure Blob and Amazon S3. It works with Windows machines too, in case\nyou want to add one of those to your free account.

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/stereotype1.webp\" alt=\"stereotype1\" /></p>\n<p>I'm not going to pretend that I don't make assumptions about people from time to time because, as much as I try not to, I fall into the trap occasionally. I'm glad that, for the most part, plenty of other people and I seem to be less inclined to do it these days. We are learning not to assume that when someone is married, it's necessarily to someone of the opposite sex. We aren't as surprised when we find out that our friend's new love interest is from a different race. I love meeting someone who is into technology as much as I am who doesn't play video games, so I don't feel like such an outsider.</p>\n<p>At the university where I work, the Dean of the College of Arts, Humanities & Sciences, who is a Professor of Religion & Philosophy, is covered in tattoos. The university chief of staff, a diminutive ex-banker, swears like a sailor. The football coach, who looks for all the world like a defensive tackle, turns out to have been a record-setting quarterback in college. The best network engineer I ever worked with talks with an accent that would fit right in \"The Dukes of Hazzard\" or \"Hee-Haw.\"</p>\n<p>People from other regions of the country (or the world) can easily have stereotypes of those of us from the South here in the US. That stereotype is that we are conservative, a little (or a lot) racist, old-fashioned, and uneducated. I always feel that I need to establish my progressive bona fides quickly, especially if someone knows I'm also a veteran or that I worked in manufacturing. I have to do that for my fellow Southerners too, just to keep the ones who actually are conservative racists from trying to include me in their conversations. I am not the type to ever hide a single facet of my personality or beliefs from anyone. I want people to know exactly who and what they are dealing with.</p>\n<p>It seems to be a driving force within conservatism to work towards putting people back into stereotypical roles. Organizations that have used DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) are routinely attacked by Republicans, who paint the whole idea as a disturbance to the natural order of the world. They want women and people of color to stay in their traditional places. They make no secret of their disdain for same-sex marriage. When they try to practice inclusion, they use unqualified bootlickers like Herschel Walker or Mark Robinson or someone with the flawed party loyalty of Nikki Haley.</p>\n<p>Learning how to escape thinking in stereotypes can be a lifelong process. Some people seem to naturally escape those kinds of attitudes, while others, like me, have had to be deprogrammed throughout our lives. I'm sure I have a long way to go, but I'm happy with how far I have come. Being open-minded is the goal.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

In the intervening 10 months that I have been back creating things on the IndyWeb on Micro.blog, Scribbles, OMG.LOL and BearBlog, I have learned a lot about how to make my web pages do what I want and how to include certain elements. The learning process is ongoing, and I am always on the lookout for use tools.

The pharmacy used to put my medicine back on the shelf until they learned my patterns. I told Wonder Woman that I was going to buy a new pair of shoes for about a year before I actually ordered them. It's not that I am lazy; I do plenty. It's just that I need A LOT of time to think about doing things before actually doing them. I don't know why the prospect of seeing something that needs to be done and then actually doing it is repugnant to me, but it is.</p>\n<p>I have collected quotes for years. I have a number of applications to keep them, plus a plain text <a href='https://github.com/cyclelou/Amerpie'>repository that I maintain on GitHub.</a> I'm super diligent about identifying quotes I want to save, copying them to a specific workspace in an app I use, and making sure I've got all the pertinent metadata: author, source, etc. And that's where the process gets bogged down. I may wait until I have 40 or 50 quotes saved up before I sit down and make myself catalog and tag them and file them in the various places where I like to keep them for reference. For a while, I tried to make doing that a part of my nightly checklist, but that habit did not stick.</p>\n<p>There are other computer-related chores that I put off. I have all the emails from Netflix, Hulu, Max, etc. filtered into a specific mailbox so that I can go through them all at one time and add shows and movies that look promising to our playlists. I have an app, <a href='https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/sequel-entertainment-database'>Sequel</a>, that consolidates the playlists, so I don't even have to go to multiple websites to add them. I even have a recurring task set up in my to-do app to remind me to do this every Sunday, typically the slowest day of the week. Yeah, I am about three months behind.</p>\n<p>We have a spare bedroom where I usually take naps on off days. The cheap bed frame I ordered from Amazon literally came apart, as in it separated into pieces. I was still napping away on the mattress and putting up with the crazy tilt and weird lumps. Wonder Woman found out about it, and BOOM, instantly fixed. She is a procrastination enabler.</p>\n<p>Some things can't be put off, obviously. One of my jobs is preparing dinner for us. She is perpetually hungry because her ultramarathon training burns a lot of calories, and she needs to keep her energy levels up. I learned a long time ago that delaying meal times was a non-starter in our house. All I need is a hangry super heroine coming at me looking for a meal!</p>\n<p>I'm also pretty disciplined about my blogging. I am currently riding a 204-day streak of posting every day. If I know I'm going to have a busy night, I try to knock something out in the morning before work or at lunch, although sometimes I just have to stay up late. When it comes to habits, I am always better off if I do them 100% regularly. The last time I meditated with discipline, I managed a 365-day streak, and my Apple Watch rings record is a consecutive 617 days without missing one. All this is balanced by streaks I have for putting things off, like replacing my deck, which I have now successfully stalled for two-plus years.</p>\n<p>I don't think this makes me a terrible person. At least, I hope it doesn't. One day I might have to do something about it. .<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

				"title": "My Letter to a Homophobic Friend",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/gsa-less-than250.webp\" alt=\"gsa-less-than250\" /></p>\n<p>I'm a digital pack rat who enjoys browsing through decades-old emails and blog posts from the 90s when I was on GeoCities. I recently found a letter I wrote to a homophobic friend in 1997, where I tried to disabuse him of some backward notions and challenge some of his beliefs. I won't reprint the whole thing because parts of it are cringeworthy, and I use language in it that wouldn't fly today. However, I am glad to see that most of what I believed 27 years ago, I still believe today.</p>\n<p>My friend was unhappy that the use of the word \"homophobia\" was becoming common. He said no one was afraid of gay people and that there was no fear involved. My response dipped into armchair psychology mode, but in hindsight, I still see it as a valid argument.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is a fear of homosexuals in our society. I believe almost everyone has, at some point, either had some sort of homosexual experience (rarely) or had a homosexual fantasy (commonly). This act or thought provokes such shame and guilt in some people, usually men, that a strong aversion occurs—one that is so psychologically entwined with self-identity that an overemphasis occurs in denying or rejecting the act or thought. We all know men who are so insecure they can't carry their wife's purse for her, buy her tampons, or admit that Tom Cruise is handsome. Why? Because someone might think they are gay, and since they once had a homosexual fantasy, they might be gay. So they better tell some [gay] jokes, buy themselves a four-wheel-drive pickup, a shotgun, and a Pit Bull, and put that rumor to rest right now.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>His other complaint was that the \"homosexual agenda\" was being pushed and promoted. I think the people doing the promotion were \"the liberals\" and \"the media.\" This was during the Clinton administration, when the culture wars were just getting started, but the flames of it were already burning brightly.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Since I live in North Carolina, prime Bible Belt country, I don't get to see this homosexual promotion everyone is talking about. In fact, I see the opposite. People may not use the N-word much anymore, but calling someone the other F-word happens all the time. Some of the gay people I know are ridiculed, shunned, and ostracized. I've never known a gay recruiter sent by the National Gay Headquarters to a lonely post in my town to convert school children to the cause. I do know my company doesn't fire openly gay employees as it did ten years ago, but I also know people who don't feel sorry for AIDS victims. Logic tells me that no one chooses to be gay any more than you choose to be straight. Who would pick a lifestyle that offers the possibility of harassment, discrimination, the loss of family ties, and the small chance of ever being a parent?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thankfully, some of my arguments seem simplistic today. Maybe they are even regarded as common sense. As a straight guy with the privilege that entails, I have the luxury of only thinking about the subject when I feel like it or when I see some backward behavior. Unfortunately, the right wing has chosen to ramp up its attacks with things like banning books about LGBT issues and making Tim Walz's sponsorship of the Gay/Straight Alliance at the high school where he taught into an issue.</p>\n<p>Since I wrote that letter, some positive things have happened in American society. Same-sex marriage was legalized, and lots of people now know same-sex couples. Contrary to the fearmongering by conservatives, none of us straight folks had to get divorced, nor is it now legal to marry your pet. You can also be gay and out in the military without jeopardizing your career. Last time I checked, the US wasn't threatened by another country due to the weak state of the Army and Marines. I'm glad both of those things have happened, and I hope that an inevitable future conservative win in an election doesn't undermine them.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

Football coaches and motivational speakers may beg to differ, but they have a vested interest in making people think that they can always just try harder to achieve success by whatever definition is popular that day. I don't buy it. I believe that people want to succeed. They want to be good parents, good employees, good spouses. Hell, they just want to be good. In the real world though we are faced with all kinds of mundane challenges, from differing energy levels, differing states of mental clarity and motivational levels that rise and fall on a sea of different inputs.</p>\n<p>I'm not advocating using this sentiment as a cop out for slacking. I'm advocating it as an explanation for the human condition. There are healthy methods of self-criticism, and then there are unhealthy feelings of low self-worth or guilt that serves no purpose. A certain amount of staring at one's own belly button is OK, but excessive bouts of obsessing over previous life choices is a self-centered exercise that serves little purpose. Learning how to be easy on yourself is the first step in extending that same level of acceptance to those you feel have let you down in life, whether it be your parents, former bosses or the bully in third grade.</p>\n<p>I started my parenting journey as an 18-year-old living in a trailer park making $4.25 an hour, riding a Sears bicycle to work. By the time my oldest left to join the Navy, I owned a home, a couple of cars and had a state job from which I retired. Today that kid (now 41) manages a team of 600 people, talks to me all the time and has a life that would make plenty of people envious. He turned out just fine. I made plenty of mistakes with my kids. I don't say that lightly at all. Of course, I wish I'd been better in the Dad game, but I know longer wallow in any kind of guilt. My love for them never wavered, and that is what's important.</p>\n<p>As a four times married recovering alcoholic with bipolar disorder, you better believed that I have regrets. I just don't have self-loathing. Life can be incredibly hard for the best equipped among us. Throw in a few handicaps and we all become miracles very quickly.</p>\n<p>Everyone has a story. Everyone has things in their life other people don't know about. You can't tell who is recovering from a family death, who suffers from chronic pain, or who is desperately searching for an antidepressant that actually works. Some people make a big deal about not being judgmental, but I don't buy it. Being judgmental is a survival skill. I make judgments all the time, but I try not to do it in a way that lets other people live rent-free in my head. In my line of work, I deal with people who don't like or understand technology. Some get frustrated easily and act out when their computer doesn't do what they want it to. I don't like being treated rudely, who does, but I understand where they are coming from. I just file them in the appropriate mental category and I move on, or at least I try.</p>\n<p>I don't pretend to love every one. I can't use \"they're doing the best they can\" to solve all my issues with the world. It doesn't help me understand or forgive Trump supporters, uncaring bosses or various flavors of mean people, but it definitely helps me deal with the people I care about.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/oil.webp\" alt=\"Oil Well\" /></p>\n<p>Somehow, when I first investigated starting a blog, I managed to avoid the many websites devoted to creating a money-making machine <strong>USING THESE 10 SIMPLE TRICKS!!!</strong> The blogs I was familiar with weren't covered in ads, and I didn't have to pay to read them. There was an occasional invitation to buy the writer a coffee, but nothing high-pressure or gross.</p>\n<p>A couple of weeks ago, Keenan, the creator of A Very Good Blog, <a href='https://gkeenan.co/avgb/ive-missed-sam-for-a-very-long-time-or-pick-your-battles/'>wrote a long, heartfelt post</a> about his lifelong relationship with his much-loved cousin and how the American political divide affected their relationship. It's the kind of work that deserves to be included in an anthology and everyone's Best of 2024 collections. It wasn't surrounded by banner advertisements or cut off in the middle with a place for paying customers to log in. No, it was offered to the world as the work of art it most certainly is. Many people have now read it, shared it, cried over it, and been inspired by it. The ability to write like that is a gift Keenan shares with the world. The people who recognize the richness of the Indy Web, the small web, and the blogs that comprise it are the grateful beneficiaries of Keenan's largesse. They, I mean, we, are a community who share pieces of ourselves, of our lives with one another because we feel called to do it.</p>\n<p>I like to write, and of course, I want what I publish to be seen by as many people who might care to read it, but I don't want to approach what I have to share with a marketer's eye. My blogging style is mostly autobiographical and very personal. I write about my life, warts and all. I feel good when I finish a post. I'd never want to worry that I needed to appeal to this or that demographic or use certain keywords to make Google like me. I just want to tell stories, make people think, and be a part of the small group that rejects corporate algorithms in favor of honest engagement with an audience that isn't manipulated into viewing <a href='https://louplummer.lol/'>Living Out Loud</a>, <a href='https://louplummer.lol/'>Linkage</a>, or <a href='https://apps.louplummer.lol/'>AppAddict</a>.</p>\n<p>Since 1994 I've made a living by helping people with technology problems in one way or another. Luckily, my interest in computers hasn't been ruined by doing it for a living. But that's just it. I already have a profession I love. I have no more desire to pad my bank account by blogging than I do in finding a way to monetize my bicycle or my hiking boots. It's shameful that there's a movement in this country to have people monetize their hobbies when what we need is a movement to make sure working people earn enough from their jobs so that they can have meaningful lives away from work.</p>\n<p>I make no claims at artistry. I'm just a guy with a laptop and some spare time. I'm grateful to anyone who uses part of their precious minutes on this earth to read what I post. I'm not planning on stopping, and I don't think I'll ever be interested in taking money out of your pocket.\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/paranoia-mike-king.webp\" alt=\"paranoia-mike-king\" /></p>\n<p>Being appropriately cautious is a survival skill. We have evolved to do things like sniff food before we eat it to make sure it isn't spoiled and to keep our guard up around strangers. A lot of human behavior is understandable in that context. I wouldn't consider myself reckless in any way. I drive cautiously enough. I haven't been in any kind of physical confrontation in decades.</p>\n<p>Certain cautious behavior is gender based and makes perfect sense. Like most men, I don't think about being the victim of sexual assault. Most people have individualized reasons for their comfort with risk. I get it.</p>\n<p>Having said all that, I'm still not cool with paranoia. There is a certain amount of risk inherent in being a functional adult and no one gets to escape from all of it. When I see a person who is so risk averse that they deprive themselves, or worse, they deprive others, it drives me nuts. I like computers and software. It's kind of my thing. I see many, many people who act terrified to install or use all kinds of software out of unfounded or unspecified fears. I'm not just talking about technologically ignorant people either. There are people in my industry who think that there is something or someone nefarious behind every new app. There are ways to investigate these issues and ways to mitigate risk. Quit being paranoid!</p>\n<p>In jobs I have had, I trust that my bosses have enough faith in me to make professional decisions when a new situation arises. It's a judgment call, of course. There are times when one needs to seek guidance. Most of the time, however, I have no problem making a call and moving forward to get a job done. If my decisions are questioned, I feel fairly confident that I can defend them. I am sure you have encountered people though who get paralyzed if they are faced with the unknown. They come to a dead stop and act as if they just know they will \"get in trouble\" if they do anything without running it by the boss first. I want to grab these people by the neck and shake them. Quit being paranoid you sorry excuse for an adult. Quit trying to evade all responsibility. Grow a pair.</p>\n<p>Then there are the people who are sure that the mysterious \"they\" are out there thwarting progress and holding back the common man. The people who blame \"them\" without ever trying to get to the bottom of who \"they\" might be are another category I'm pretty derisive about. There is no doubt that giant corporations do not have society's best interest at heart. Capitalism is not structured that way. Rather than railing against the unknown, however, learn to name and shame the people and organizations behind your oppression. Let that knowledge influence how you vote and where you spend your money. We have limited power as individuals, but we do have some, plus we have the power to organize and to take collective action. That's how slavery was ended, how women got the vote, how child labor was outlawed and how every labor protection in existence came into being. Quit being paranoid. Do something!</p>\n<p>If anything about this offends you, I do not apologize. Quit being paranoid!<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

Using\noption+click will hide the current front app while opening the app you\nclick on. The app switcher has a context menu for each app and supports\ndragging items to the icons to open them.</p>\n\n<p>As would be expected from a developer known for having exacting\npreferences in his workspace, you can fine tune almost every element in\nthe app. Switch Glass is $7.99 on the <a\nhref=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/switchglass/id1498546559?ls=1&amp;mt=12\">Mac\nApp Store.</a></p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Switch Glass - A Configurable Application Switcher with Per Display Settings' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

I&#39;ve been a\nKeyboard Maestro user for many years. I have over 800 macros within that\napplication and a lot of experience using it, but after working with\nKeysmith for just a short while, I have to admit it makes some actions\neasier to record and activate. It&#39;s not a replacement for Keyboard\nMaestro, but it will certainly supplement it.</p>\n\n<p>Keysmith detects buttons, lists, and page loads automatically. The first\nmacro I created with it was able to Open Obsidian, copy my daily note,\nopen Day One, create a new entry and paste the content from Obsidian. I\nassigned it to HyperKey+D and was able to trigger it while I was in my\nweb browser. I tinkered with it a little and was easily able to get it\nto close Day One after the entry was created.</p>\n\n<p>The process is simple. You start the recording of a macro from a button\non the menu bar. Your perform the action you need and Keysmith records\nyour clicks and keystrokes. When you&#39;re done, you save the macro, give\nit a name and assign a hotkey if you want to.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the example macros available for download on the Keysmith web\nsite are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Refresh extensions in Chrome</li>\n<li>Share screen in Discord</li>\n<li>Eject external hard drive in Finder</li>\n<li>Assign and submit a pull request on GitHub</li>\n<li>Enable Dark Mode in macOS</li>\n<li>New note with template in Apple Notes</li>\n<li>Switch to a specific Slack channel</li>\n<li>Switch to Zoom gallery view</li>\n<li>Quit all apps with AppleScript</li>\n<li>Close Notification Center in macOS</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You can use <a href=\"https://www.keysmith.app/purchase\">the total\nfunctionality of Keysmith for free</a> to make up to five macros. The\nfull version is $54. It is also available as part of <a\nhref=\"https://go.setapp.com/invite/kmjmclw4\">Setapp</a>.</p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Keysmith - Record Automation Macros With Ease' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

This week I\nfound out that an ancient app (well, 17 years), <a\nhref=\"https://amarsagoo.info/licensed/\">Licensed</a>, has been updated\nand is compatible with macOS 15. Licensed is a simple database to keep\ntrack of your software purchases. It has fields for:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Maker</li>\n<li>Product</li>\n<li>Version</li>\n<li>Owner</li>\n<li>Email</li>\n<li>Code</li>\n<li>Date</li>\n<li>Notes</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The database is searchable. From the app&#39;s file menu, you can identify\nthe data file for easy backups, and you can export your data as a CSV\nfile so that you can be assured you aren&#39;t locked into any proprietary\nformat.</p>\n\n<p>Licensed is a free app from developer <a\nhref=\"https://amarsagoo.info/\">Amar Sagoo</a>. You can <a\nhref=\"https://amarsagoo.info/licensed/\">download it on his website.</a></p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Licensed - A Nice Single Purpose App for Keeping Track of Your Software' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

As an Obsidian sync subscriber, not only am I contributing to a company I value, I also get to control all kinds of things I couldn&rsquo;t do before. Restoring deleted files either singularly or in bulk is supported. I also get tech support for syncing issues.</p>\n<h3 id=\"selective-sync\">Selective Sync</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2024/990df6e29f.jpeg\" alt=\"Selective Sync in Obsidian\"></p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t want to sync a number of larger folders on my phone to help Obsidian load faster, so I can exclude those from search.

That&rsquo;s a wise attitude to take for plugins that affect data, but what about plugins that just make Obsidian easier to use? What&rsquo;s the reason for not trying those? These 10 plugins don&rsquo;t leave any code fragments in your notes. They just make Obsidian better.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1-commanderhttpsgithubcomphibr0obsidian-commander\">1. <a href=\"https://github.com/phibr0/obsidian-commander\">Commander</a></h2>\n<p>Commander lets you add and remove commands from the Obsidian interface.

Mononote does one thing, it keeps you from having multiple copies of the same note open at once. If you ever looked at your tab bar and seen multiple copies of your daily note staring at you, install this plugin to prevent that from ever happening again.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5-note-refactorhttpsgithubcomlynchjamesnote-refactor-obsidian\">5. <a href=\"https://github.com/lynchjames/note-refactor-obsidian\">Note Refactor</a></h2>\n<p>Note Refactor helps you split and extract content from your current notes.

Plugin Update Tracker lets me know at a glance if I have any updates and to what plugins. It will let me read the release notes and even wait a specified number days before notifying me when updates become available so that the early adopters can get the kinks worked out.

Videos from YouTube, Billibilli, TikTok and Vimeo will be displayed in an inline iFrame based on the clipboard URL. Mastodon toots and URLs will be imported as complete notes generated from nothing more than a URL on your clipboard. It&rsquo;s one of the easiest ways to get web content in your blog.

				"content_html": "<p>Last week I posted <a href=\"https://amerpie.lol/2024/05/25/random-but-helpful.html\">some of the things I learned to do in Obsidian through trial and error</a> and it went over pretty good, so here are 10 more. I want to show folks not to be afraid of extensions. Many of them don&rsquo;t alter your data in any way so you won&rsquo;t get locked in by using them. They just perform actions that make Obsidian run in a more customized way for you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1-have-obsidian-open-to-the-same-page-every-time-you-start-the-app\">1. Have Obsidian Open to the Same Page Every Time You Start the App</h2>\n<p>By default, Obsidian opens up to the state you left it in when you closed it. With the <a href=\"https://github.com/mirnovov/obsidian-homepage\">Homepage community plugin</a> - you can use any note, canvas, or workspace as a homepage. Alternatively, choose a random note, or use your Daily or Periodic Notes. You can decide what happens to old tabs that were left open - keep them, replace the last note, or remove them all.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2-assign-a-basic-set-of-file-properties-to-every-note-you-create\">2. Assign a Basic Set of File Properties to Every Note You Create</h2>\n<p>You can do this using the Linter plugin. The setting is on the YAML tab of the options for Linter.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2024/cleanshot-2024-06-01-at-19.20.292x.jpeg\" alt=\"Setting for file properties in the Linter plugin for Obsidian\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"3-edit-the-file-properties-of-multiple-notes-at-one-time\">3. Edit the File Properties of Multiple Notes at One time</h2>\n<p>If you have multiple notes where you&rsquo;d like to add or remove file properties in one fell swoop without having to edit them each individually, the use the <a href=\"https://github.com/fez-github/obsidian-multi-properties\">Multi-Properties plugin</a>. It works for tags or any other file property you want.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4-send-an-email-to-your-obsidian-vault-for-mac-users\">4. Send an Email to Your Obsidian Vault (for Mac users)</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2024/cleanshot-2024-06-01-at-19.32.482x.jpeg\" alt=\"An IFTTT applet to create text files in Dropbox based on emails\"></p>\n<p>Set up an IFTTT applet to create a text file in a cloud service like based on an email you send to a certain address. Then use the app, <a href=\"https://www.noodlesoft.com/\">Hazel</a>, to have the file renamed with a .md extension and moved to your vault. <a href=\"https://amerpie.lol/2024/02/04/how-to-send.html\">More information on setting this up</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"5-quickly-capture-data-to-your-obsidian-vault-on-ios\">5. Quickly Capture Data to Your Obsidian Vault on iOS</h2>\n<p>The key to this at this point is using the right third-party app. I personally use <a href=\"https://getdrafts.com/\">Drafts</a> most of the time, but have recently been experimenting with a new app, <a href=\"https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/bebop-quick-notes\">Bebop</a> and with <a href=\"https://www.fleetingnotes.app/\">Fleeting Notes</a>. The Obsidian roadmap states that they are hard at work improving the native abilities of Obsidian on mobile. <a href=\"https://amerpie.lol/2024/02/22/obsidian-great-but.html\">More software to complement Obsidian.</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"6-search-and-replace-text-across-your-entire-vault-at-once\">6. Search And Replace Text Across Your Entire Vault at Once</h2>\n<p>To do this, you can use the free features of different power-users text editors  I use <a href=\"https://notepad-plus-plus.org/\">Notepad++</a> (PC) and <a href=\"https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/\">BBedit</a> (Mac) for multi-file search and replace. They’re both fast, handle case-matching, and the basic features are free. <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\">Vscode</a> is another favorite and it is cross-platform.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2024/cleanshot-2024-06-01-at-19.51.462x.jpeg\" alt=\"Search and replace in BBEdit\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"7-automatically-sync-a-backup-copy-of-your-vault-to-a-cloud-service-every-night-while-you-sleep\">7. Automatically Sync a Backup Copy of Your Vault to a Cloud Service Every Night While You Sleep</h2>\n<p>You need a couple of utilities to make this happen. The first is a file-syncing utility that runs automatic syncs. I use <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sync-folders/id530573877\">Sync Folders Pro</a>, a $9 app from the app store. Then you need an app that automatically launched your sync program. On the Mac you can use <a href=\"https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/lingon-x-finds-all-the-junk\">Lingon X,</a> <a href=\"https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/\">Keyboard Maestro</a> or <a href=\"https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/alarm-clock-pro\">Alarm Clock Pro</a>. <a href=\"https://amerpie.lol/2024/02/11/automating-your-obsidian.html\">More backup information</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8-import-entire-web-pages-with-nothing-more-than-a-url-on-the-clipboard\">8. Import Entire Web Pages with Nothing More Than a URL on The Clipboard</h2>\n<p>One of the features of the <a href=\"https://github.com/DominikPieper/obsidian-ReadItLater\">ReadItLater plugin</a>is to create a a new based on nothing more than a URL on your clipboard. You just copy an address from a web page you want to save, switch to Obsidian and activate it ReadItLater from the command pallet. It&rsquo;s that fast and that easy. <a href=\"https://amerpie.lol/2024/03/02/all-the-ways.html\">More ways to import web pages</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"9-a-wizard-to-build-dataview-queries\">9. A Wizard to Build Dataview Queries</h2>\n<p>There is a free tool you can use to help with the learning curve with Dataview. <a href=\"https://s-blu.github.io/basic-dataview-query-builder/\">“The Basic Dataview Query Builder</a> will guide you through some questions and put together a Dataview query based on your answers.

Have Obsidian Open to the Same Page Every Time You Start the App\r\n\r\nBy default, Obsidian opens up to the state you left it in when you closed it. With the [Homepage community plugin](https://github.com/mirnovov/obsidian-homepage) - you can use any note, canvas, or workspace as a homepage. Alternatively, choose a random note, or use your Daily or Periodic Notes. You can decide what happens to old tabs that were left open - keep them, replace the last note, or remove them all.\r\n\r\n## 2. Assign a Basic Set of File Properties to Every Note You Create\r\n\r\nYou can do this using the Linter plugin. The setting is on the YAML tab of the options for Linter.\r\n\r\n![Setting for file properties in the Linter plugin for Obsidian](https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2024/cleanshot-2024-06-01-at-19.20.292x.jpeg)\r\n\r\n## 3. Edit the File Properties of Multiple Notes at One time\r\n\r\nIf you have multiple notes where you'd like to add or remove file properties in one fell swoop without having to edit them each individually, the use the [Multi-Properties plugin](https://github.com/fez-github/obsidian-multi-properties). It works for tags or any other file property you want.\r\n\r\n## 4. Send an Email to Your Obsidian Vault (for Mac users)\r\n\r\n![An IFTTT applet to create text files in Dropbox based on emails](https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2024/cleanshot-2024-06-01-at-19.32.482x.jpeg)\r\n\r\nSet up an IFTTT applet to create a text file in a cloud service like based on an email you send to a certain address. Then use the app, [Hazel](https://www.noodlesoft.com/), to have the file renamed with a .md extension and moved to your vault. [More information on setting this up](https://amerpie.lol/2024/02/04/how-to-send.html)\r\n\r\n## 5. Quickly Capture Data to Your Obsidian Vault on iOS\r\n\r\nThe key to this at this point is using the right third-party app. I personally use [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/) most of the time, but have recently been experimenting with a new app, [Bebop](https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/bebop-quick-notes) and with [Fleeting Notes](https://www.fleetingnotes.app/). The Obsidian roadmap states that they are hard at work improving the native abilities of Obsidian on mobile. [More software to complement Obsidian.](https://amerpie.lol/2024/02/22/obsidian-great-but.html)\r\n\r\n## 6. Search And Replace Text Across Your Entire Vault at Once\r\n\r\nTo do this, you can use the free features of different power-users text editors  I use [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (PC) and [BBedit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) (Mac) for multi-file search and replace. They’re both fast, handle case-matching, and the basic features are free. [Vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is another favorite and it is cross-platform.\r\n\r\n![Search and replace in BBEdit](https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2024/cleanshot-2024-06-01-at-19.51.462x.jpeg)\r\n\r\n## 7. Automatically Sync a Backup Copy of Your Vault to a Cloud Service Every Night While You Sleep\r\n\r\nYou need a couple of utilities to make this happen. The first is a file-syncing utility that runs automatic syncs. I use [Sync Folders Pro](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sync-folders/id530573877), a $9 app from the app store. Then you need an app that automatically launched your sync program. On the Mac you can use [Lingon X,](https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/lingon-x-finds-all-the-junk) [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/) or [Alarm Clock Pro](https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/alarm-clock-pro). [More backup information](https://amerpie.lol/2024/02/11/automating-your-obsidian.html).\r\n\r\n##  8. Import Entire Web Pages with Nothing More Than a URL on The Clipboard\r\n\r\nOne of the features of the [ReadItLater plugin](https://github.com/DominikPieper/obsidian-ReadItLater)is to create a a new based on nothing more than a URL on your clipboard. You just copy an address from a web page you want to save, switch to Obsidian and activate it ReadItLater from the command pallet. It's that fast and that easy. [More ways to import web pages](https://amerpie.lol/2024/03/02/all-the-ways.html)\r\n\r\n## 9. A Wizard to Build Dataview Queries\r\n\r\nThere is a free tool you can use to help with the learning curve with Dataview. [“The Basic Dataview Query Builder](https://s-blu.github.io/basic-dataview-query-builder/) will guide you through some questions and put together a Dataview query based on your answers. You can use this query as-is in your vault or as a starting point to refine a more advanced query.\r\n\r\n## 10. Get Ideas for Notes or Vaults You Can Create in Obsidian\r\n\r\n- [Here's a list of 77 different note types you can create.](https://amerpie.lol/2024/04/28/types-of-notes.html)\r\n- [Here are 15 sample vaults from around the Internet you can download and experiment with.](https://amerpie.lol/2024/05/13/example-obsidian-vaults.html)\r\n",

Create a Map of Content Automatically for Any Folder or Subfolder That You Can Copy and Paste as Plain Text\r\n\r\nIf you use Dataview to create MOCs, good luck exporting or copying them. You need two plugins for to make that happen [Folder Note](https://github.com/xpgo/obsidian-folder-note-plugin) and [Waypoint](https://github.com/IdreesInc/Waypoint).\r\n\r\n![A Waypoint Created MOC](https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2024/cleanshot-2024-05-25-at-16.52.242x.jpeg)\r\n\r\n## 7. Use Cool Icons With All of Your Obsidian Folders\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to visually enhance your folders like shown below, install the Iconize community plugin.\r\n\r\n![Obsidian Folders with Icons](https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2024/cleanshot-2024-05-25-at-16.56.372x.jpeg)\r\n\r\n## 8. Import Entire Articles from Omnivore, Not Just Highlights and Notes\r\n\r\nIf you want to use the free red-it-later service to import the entire text of web pages instead of the default behavior which just brings in highlights and notes, you can tweak your article template like this.\r\n\r\n\r\n`````\r\n> # {{{title}}}\r\n> #Omnivore\r\n> \r\n> [Read on Omnivore]({{{omnivoreUrl}}})\r\n> [Read Original]({{{originalUrl}}})\r\n> \r\n> {{#note}}\r\n> \r\n> {{{note}}}\r\n> {{/note}}\r\n> \r\n> {{{ content }}}\r\n`````\r\n## 9. Customize Your Sidebars\r\n\r\nIn Obsidian, you can drag and drop elements like notes, links, or files to the sidebars to move or create new links. Simply drag the element you want to move and drop it onto the sidebar where you want it to be placed.\r\n\r\n![The right sidebar of the Obsidian Window](https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2024/cleanshot-2024-05-25-at-17.04.432x.jpeg)\r\n\r\n## 10. To Add a Geotag and Timestamp to a Note on iOS\r\n\r\nThis one requires Drafts, which all Mac/iOS users should have any way. [This action](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/2Fc) will append the info to your daily note but it is easy to edit to create a note instead of appending it.\n",

You select a folder and provide criteria about what you want to happen to the files and folders in that folder and Hazel periodically checks it and runs the rules. Hazel can move, copy, rename and convert files. Criteria you can use include all of a file&rsquo;s native attributes and even file contents. A lot of folks use it to scan PDFs of their bills for a specific account number and automatically move the file to a folder in their paperless record management system.</p>\n<p>These are my favorite Hazel Actions</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Unzip any compressed files in my Downloads folder and trash the zip file</strong> - This helps keep my downloads folder cleared of the detritus that occurs because I am a compulsive software addict.</li>\n<li><strong>Install apps inside DMGs in my downloads folder via <a href=\"https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/rapidmg-automating-downloads-and-installs\">RapiDMG</a> and then trash the DMG</strong> - When I download a disk image file with an app in it, I don&rsquo;t have to do anything else to get the app moved to my Applications folder. It happens in seconds with no intervention from me unless I have to approve replacing an existing file.</li>\n<li><strong>Import any image file I place in an Images folder into the Photos app (in the background)</strong> - I&rsquo;m constantly copying photos from Facebook and various web sites. I have them to a folder I have designated in Hazel and they automatically get imported into my photos library with me even opening the app.</li>\n<li><strong>Change any text file in my Dropbox to a markdown file and move it to my Obsidian vault (useful in sending emails to Obsidian)</strong> - I use an <a href=\"https://ifttt.com/explore\">IFTTT</a> applet that allows me to forward emails to a specific address. Those emails are save in a specific folder in my Dropbox account that Hazel watches. When a file appears there, Hazel changes the file extension from txt to md and moves the resulting file into my Obsidian vault. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>\n<li><strong>Sort all files in my documents folder into subfolders based on file extension.</strong> - I currently have 42 sub-folders in my documents folder of different file types ranging from the usual suspects like txt and docx to the more esoteric like saved <a href=\"https://www.houdah.com/houdahSpot/\">HoudahSpot</a> searched and <a href=\"https://etrecheck.com/en/index.html\">Etrecheck</a> Reports.</li>\n<li><strong>Purge old screenshots</strong> - between my day job and my blogging past time, I generate a lot of screenshots. Hazel moves any screenshots more than three days old into an archive folder to help give a semblance of order.</li>\n<li><strong>Color code any application I haven&rsquo;t opened in three months</strong> - I have 416 apps installed on my mac because, well, I just can&rsquo;t help myself. Hazel will color an unused app red after not launching it for 90 days to help me decide whether to keep it or remove it with <a href=\"https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/\">AppCleaner</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep my desktop clean</strong> - I do not like to use my desktop as part of my file system. I rarely even see it since I run apps maximized most of the time. This rule moves any file that ends up on my desktop into a folder in my home directory. I exclude aliases from the rule because there are times when I want to make an app shortcut on the desktop, usually temporarily.</li>\n</ol>\n",

A lot of folks use it to scan PDFs of their bills for a specific account number and automatically move the file to a folder in their paperless record management system.\r\n\r\nThese are my favorite Hazel Actions\r\n\r\n1. **Unzip any compressed files in my Downloads folder and trash the zip file** - This helps keep my downloads folder cleared of the detritus that occurs because I am a compulsive software addict. \r\n2. **Install apps inside DMGs in my downloads folder via [RapiDMG](https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/rapidmg-automating-downloads-and-installs) and then trash the DMG** - When I download a disk image file with an app in it, I don't have to do anything else to get the app moved to my Applications folder. It happens in seconds with no intervention from me unless I have to approve replacing an existing file.\r\n3. **Import any image file I place in an Images folder into the Photos app (in the background)** - I'm constantly copying photos from Facebook and various web sites. I have them to a folder I have designated in Hazel and they automatically get imported into my photos library with me even opening the app.\r\n4. **Change any text file in my Dropbox to a markdown file and move it to my Obsidian vault (useful in sending emails to Obsidian)** - I use an [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/explore) applet that allows me to forward emails to a specific address. Those emails are save in a specific folder in my Dropbox account that Hazel watches. When a file appears there, Hazel changes the file extension from txt to md and moves the resulting file into my Obsidian vault. <img src=\"https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2024/hazel.jpeg\" width=\"600\" height=\"324\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A computer desktop screen shows an open file manager window with a list of folders on the left and search options on the right, against a mountainous landscape wallpaper.\">\r\n5. **Sort all files in my documents folder into subfolders based on file extension.** - I currently have 42 sub-folders in my documents folder of different file types ranging from the usual suspects like txt and docx to the more esoteric like saved [HoudahSpot](https://www.houdah.com/houdahSpot/) searched and [Etrecheck](https://etrecheck.com/en/index.html) Reports.\r\n6. **Purge old screenshots** - between my day job and my blogging past time, I generate a lot of screenshots. Hazel moves any screenshots more than three days old into an archive folder to help give a semblance of order.\r\n7. **Color code any application I haven't opened in three months** - I have 416 apps installed on my mac because, well, I just can't help myself. Hazel will color an unused app red after not launching it for 90 days to help me decide whether to keep it or remove it with [AppCleaner](https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/).\r\n8. **Keep my desktop clean** - I do not like to use my desktop as part of my file system. I rarely even see it since I run apps maximized most of the time. This rule moves any file that ends up on my desktop into a folder in my home directory. I exclude aliases from the rule because there are times when I want to make an app shortcut on the desktop, usually temporarily.\r\n",

Tech bloggers and Reddit sang its praises and kept pointing out new features one after another. I finally relented and downloaded it. After spending my Thanksgiving break of 2023 getting it configured to match my needs, I&rsquo;ve been an enthusiastic proponent ever since.

Clipboard History</h2>\n<p>I used to use <a href=\"https://indiegoodies.com/pastepal\">Pastepal</a> and at times I miss its ability to sync my clipboard with my phone, but there are work arounds for that. By using Raycast&rsquo;s built in clipboard manager, I eliminate the need to run a separate program at all times. It&rsquo;s very convenient to assign a hotkey combo to show my clipboard history and then to navigate it without the need for a mouse.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2-kill-process\">2. Kill Process</h2>\n<p>When I have the infrequent application crash, I don&rsquo;t have to remember the Apple keyboard combo for force quitting an application nor do I have to use a mouse to click on the dock or Apple Menu.

Image Modification</h2>\n<p>As a blogger, I have a frequent need to reduce the size of images before I post them on my website. The image modification plugin acts on whatever file is selected in the finder. I specify the width I want and it figures out the height for me.

Emoji Picker</h2>\n<p>I used to use <a href=\"https://matthewpalmer.net/rocket/\">Rocket</a>, a separate program as an emoji picker but the one built into Raycast works just as well.

When I find an app, a TV show, a news story or whatever, I put it into Aboard and she gets a notification and can check it out when she has time. It&rsquo;s free and useful.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://remotedesktop.google.com/\">Chrome Remote Desktop</a> - This allows me to access my home computer from other locations.

It's a popular extension with over 200K downloads.\r\n- [Raindrop.io](https://app.raindrop.io/) - I have a subscription and heartily endorse Raindrop.io for it's cross platform support as well as its [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/raindrop) integration which really helps me when I'm researching anything\r\n- [Aboard](https://aboard.com/extension/) - This is the extension for the app my wife and I use to share links with each other. When I find an app, a TV show, a news story or whatever, I put it into Aboard and she gets a notification and can check it out when she has time. It's free and useful.\r\n- [Chrome Remote Desktop](https://remotedesktop.google.com/) - This allows me to access my home computer from other locations. It's free, easy to set up and use and reliable. I don't know what people pay for [Screens](https://www.edovia.com/en/screens/) or [TeamViewer](https://www.teamviewer.com/en/) subscriptions.\r\n- [UBlock Origin](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm)- The best ad blocker on the planet. 31,000,000 downloads can't be wrong.\r\n- [Toby](https://www.gettoby.com/) - My new tab extension. It makes it easy to save and open windows full of tabs on the go. I use the free version and even though I maintain my [start.me](https://start.me/) page, I stick with Toby for new tabs.\r\n- [Velja](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/velja/gpipdgcamiclkcomcnogmlfpalggmcmk) - Works in conjunction with the Mac app of the same name to open URLs in other bowsers and apps (e.g., Slack, Teams, Zoom, Freetube etc)\r\n- [Lastpass](https://www.lastpass.com/) - I've had a paid account shared with my wife for more than a decade. Lastpass has gotten some bad PR due to a couple of incidents, but I haven't had any issues. Still, peer pressure is getting to me and I'm looking to switch to Bitwarden when my subscription is up.\r\n- [Archive page](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/archive-page/llldbgankiiaiobhnjpbllpijlidinaf) - An indispensable extension for getting around paywalled content. I use it multiple times a dat for [Medium](https://medium.com/) posts and [Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/) articles.\r\n- [Postlight Reader](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/postlight-reader/kpldbdfpngbdadafgaccakmeaoeligcl) - The Postlight Reader extension for Microsoft Edge removes ads and distractions, leaving only text and images for a clean and consistent reading view on every site.\r\n- [Reddit Enhancement Suite](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/reddit-enhancement-suite/jlhgedjpndhblehblebhncfmkkpngiep) - I use this for one primary reason - to block pictures of other people's graphs on the [Obsidian subreddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/). LOL\r\n- [Simplify Gmail](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/simplify-gmail/mpohnjhkncdalhjdhpiphajhiahmcapn)- The only extension I pay for. It has hundreds of improvements (small and large) to streamline, simplify, and enhance Gmail's design and functionality. Hide the features you don't use, customize the ones you do including setting the list and message width and fonts.\r\n- [Raycast](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fgacdjnoljjfikkadhogeofgjoglooma) - Built-in page summary for [Raycast Pro](https://www.raycast.com/)users.\r\n- [ChatGPT for Google](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/emjhillblkjkhnclfgcahgdhjmdmeohj)- Adds a simultaneous ChatGPT search when you look for something at Google.com.\r\n- [Web Time Tracker](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/webtime-tracker/ppaojnbmmaigjmlpjaldnkgnklhicppk) - Provides stats on how much time you spend on web sites\r\n- [Street Pass for Mastodon](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/streetpass-for-mastodon/fphjfedjhinpnjblomfebcjjpdpakhhn)- StreetPass is a browser extension that helps you find your people on Mastodon. Here's how it works:\r\n\t1. Mastodon users verify themselves by adding a custom link to their personal site.\r\n\t2. StreetPass lets you know when you've found one of these links, and adds them to your StreetPass list.\r\n\t3. Browse the web as usual. StreetPass will build a list of Mastodon users made up of the websites you go to.\r\n",

				"content_html": "<p><img src=\"https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2024/cleanshot-2024-04-15-at-19.57.332x.jpeg\" alt=\"A list of Mac applications that run at startup\"></p>\n<p>We buy our computers in order to use them. Some of them get used at work so that we can earn a living. In a lot of ways they are like shovels or hammers, just tools, a means to an end. Some computers are used for a different purpose. They help us express our creativity through art, photography, poetry. They provide us a link to the news of the world, whatever world it is that we wish to live in, be it some ancient kingdom in a video game or up to the minute events in politics and war or maybe just the lives of our friends online and in real life. We get to decide. We get to choose the tools, in the form of software that we are going to use to have the experience on our computer that we want to have. In the end, it&rsquo;s all subjective. Maybe you can write a best-selling novel with TextEdit and use nothing but the stock out of the box apps on your Mac. Some do. Others, however, look for the tools that fit their styles and meet their needs in a particular way. There is no right and wrong.</p>\n<p>There are a few things that people in the Windows world get that we don&rsquo;t. Windows has a built-in clipboard manager. It has Windows management tools. We can have those things, we just have to find an app to do them for us. Most often those apps are installed so that they run when you log in to your computer. I&rsquo;m going to list the tools I want available to me when I&rsquo;m on my laptop. Every single program in the list runs as a login item on my Mac. Undoubtably, some people are going to be SMDH. Well, IDGAF. This is what it takes for me to have the experience I want.

				"content_text": "![A list of Mac applications that run at startup](https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2024/cleanshot-2024-04-15-at-19.57.332x.jpeg)\r\n\r\nWe buy our computers in order to use them. Some of them get used at work so that we can earn a living. In a lot of ways they are like shovels or hammers, just tools, a means to an end. Some computers are used for a different purpose. They help us express our creativity through art, photography, poetry. They provide us a link to the news of the world, whatever world it is that we wish to live in, be it some ancient kingdom in a video game or up to the minute events in politics and war or maybe just the lives of our friends online and in real life. We get to decide. We get to choose the tools, in the form of software that we are going to use to have the experience on our computer that we want to have. In the end, it's all subjective. Maybe you can write a best-selling novel with TextEdit and use nothing but the stock out of the box apps on your Mac. Some do. Others, however, look for the tools that fit their styles and meet their needs in a particular way. There is no right and wrong. \r\n\r\nThere are a few things that people in the Windows world get that we don't. Windows has a built-in clipboard manager. It has Windows management tools. We can have those things, we just have to find an app to do them for us. Most often those apps are installed so that they run when you log in to your computer. I'm going to list the tools I want available to me when I'm on my laptop. Every single program in the list runs as a login item on my Mac. Undoubtably, some people are going to be SMDH. Well, IDGAF. This is what it takes for me to have the experience I want. I've been using a Mac for a minute (I'm a retired Mac sysadmin from the public school system) and if an app has any kind of notoriety, I've probably tried it. Some of these apps are available on SetApp, if that's something you're interested in.

Whenever I launched the app, it would take thirty seconds to a minute to load, making it really impractical to use for quick capture. Looking for a better experience, I opted to switch to the paid Obsidian sync ($4 month). Unfortunately as I imported more notes into my vault from my previous app of choice, Evernote, it got to the point where Obsidian would not even load. It just looped into a never-ending series of crashes. The only solution I could find was to delete my files from local storage and re-download them from the cloud.</p>\n<h2 id=\"troubleshooting\">Troubleshooting</h2>\n<p>I turned to ChatGPT for help and got this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Limit your file sizes:</strong> While Obsidian is capable of handling large text files, having too many or very large files can slow down the app. Try to limit your notes to a reasonable size, and split up longer notes into smaller ones if possible.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduce the number of plugins:</strong> While plugins can add a lot of functionality to Obsidian, they can also slow it down if you have too many running at once. Try disabling any non-essential plugins to see if that improves performance.</li>\n<li><strong>Clear Cache</strong>: Sometimes the application cache gets clogged up and causes performance issues. Go into your iPhone settings &gt; General &gt; iPhone Storage &gt; Obsidian and then tap on &lsquo;Offload App&rsquo;. This will delete the app but keep all its documents and data. Then reinstall Obsidian from App Store.</li>\n<li><strong>Avoid complex queries:</strong> If you&rsquo;re using Dataview or similar plugins, try to avoid overly complex queries that might be putting a strain on the app.</li>\n<li><strong>Close background apps:</strong> Other apps running in the background could be affecting Obsidian&rsquo;s performance. Close any unnecessary apps before launching Obsidian.</li>\n<li><strong>Update iOS &amp; App:</strong> Make sure both your operating system and your app are updated to their latest versions as performance improvements are often part of updates.</li>\n<li><strong>Contact Support:</strong> If none of these tips help, it may be worth reaching out to Obsidian&rsquo;s support team directly for assistance with this issue.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Remember that syncing large amounts of data can take time and resources, so try not to overload it by adding too many new files at once or making lots of edits in a short space of time.</p>\n<p>I was kind of dubious, especially of number 5, since on iOS there really isn&rsquo;t anything like a background app. It doesn&rsquo;t work that way. I also didn&rsquo;t have any really large notes. I turned off all the plugins I didn&rsquo;t absolutely need. I wasn&rsquo;t sure what constituted a complex Dataview query. Most of mine seem simple enough, looking only for a single criteria, usually a tag. I was running the latest version of iOS and of the public release of Obsidian. My results weren&rsquo;t that different after trying these steps so I decided to contact Obsidian support, seeing how it&rsquo;s a benefit for those who pay for sync.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-official-take\">The Official Take</h2>\n<p>The response from support was quick and honest. The person who wrote me acknowledged the issues and said they were being addressed in an upcoming release. She also said &ldquo;However, it is worth noting that depending on the size of your vault, and what plugins you are using, you may be running to out of cache memory issues on this older device (remember I was rocking a four-year old phone). Obsidian is not the most lightweight of applications. D:</p>\n<p>Known amplifiers of this case:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Using heavier memory plugins like Dataview and Metabind</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Enabling the backlinks core plugin on mobile</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Enabling the graph view core plugin on mobile</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Having the vault also be in iCloud on mobile</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Known alleviations of this case separate from above:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Backing up your vault, and reinstalling Obsidian on mobile if your current install of the application was pre 17.0</strong>.&rdquo;</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"the-solution\">The Solution</h2>\n<p>I did everything tech support suggested and guess what? The problem didn&rsquo;t get any better. For me and the way I use Obsidian, an iPhone 11 wasn&rsquo;t going to cut it. I ordered an upgrade, to the 15 Pro Max and since then I haven&rsquo;t had to resort to deleting and redownloading my files. I still have to wait awhile when I launch the app while things load and sync, but it becomes useable much more quickly. I tend to use <a href=\"https://getdrafts.com/\">Drafts</a>for quick capture since it&rsquo;s so easy to move notes from there into my vault. I still have backlinks and graph view turned off and I don&rsquo;t sync certain folder that have lots of attachments. I don&rsquo;t really need my recipe collection on my phone anyway.</p>\n",

Close any unnecessary apps before launching Obsidian.\r\n6. **Update iOS & App:** Make sure both your operating system and your app are updated to their latest versions as performance improvements are often part of updates.\r\n7. **Contact Support:** If none of these tips help, it may be worth reaching out to Obsidian's support team directly for assistance with this issue.\r\n\r\nRemember that syncing large amounts of data can take time and resources, so try not to overload it by adding too many new files at once or making lots of edits in a short space of time.\r\n\r\nI was kind of dubious, especially of number 5, since on iOS there really isn't anything like a background app. It doesn't work that way. I also didn't have any really large notes. I turned off all the plugins I didn't absolutely need. I wasn't sure what constituted a complex Dataview query. Most of mine seem simple enough, looking only for a single criteria, usually a tag. I was running the latest version of iOS and of the public release of Obsidian. My results weren't that different after trying these steps so I decided to contact Obsidian support, seeing how it's a benefit for those who pay for sync.\r\n\r\n## The Official Take\r\n\r\nThe response from support was quick and honest. The person who wrote me acknowledged the issues and said they were being addressed in an upcoming release. She also said \"However, it is worth noting that depending on the size of your vault, and what plugins you are using, you may be running to out of cache memory issues on this older device (remember I was rocking a four-year old phone). Obsidian is not the most lightweight of applications. D:  \r\n\r\nKnown amplifiers of this case:  \r\n\r\n- **Using heavier memory plugins like Dataview and Metabind**  \r\n- **Enabling the backlinks core plugin on mobile**  \r\n- **Enabling the graph view core plugin on mobile**  \r\n- **Having the vault also be in iCloud on mobile**  \r\n\r\nKnown alleviations of this case separate from above:  \r\n\r\n- **Backing up your vault, and reinstalling Obsidian on mobile if your current install of the application was pre 17.0**.\"\r\n## The Solution\r\n\r\nI did everything tech support suggested and guess what? The problem didn't get any better. For me and the way I use Obsidian, an iPhone 11 wasn't going to cut it. I ordered an upgrade, to the 15 Pro Max and since then I haven't had to resort to deleting and redownloading my files. I still have to wait awhile when I launch the app while things load and sync, but it becomes useable much more quickly. I tend to use [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/)for quick capture since it's so easy to move notes from there into my vault. I still have backlinks and graph view turned off and I don't sync certain folder that have lots of attachments. I don't really need my recipe collection on my phone anyway. \n",

				"content_html": "<p><img src=\"https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2024/school.jpeg\" alt=\"https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2024/school.jpeg\"></p>\n<p>After retiring from my IT career in public education in 2020, I found myself less engaged with technology news and updates. My previous habit of upgrading my phone yearly faded, and I continued using the software already on my MacBook. An Evernote user since 2009, I relied on it for everything from technical specs to recipes. My subscription auto-renewed annually without much thought.</p>\n<p>Within a few years, it became clear that staying at home full-time wasn&rsquo;t for me. Through connections, I landed a relaxed role in the IT department at a small, private university in my hometown. It&rsquo;s the perfect post-retirement job: I enjoy helping faculty, staff, and students with their tech problems without the headaches of being on-call, budgeting, or strategic planning.</p>\n<p>Around that time, I noticed an unfamiliar program, Obsidian, gaining popularity among the tech circles I used to follow. David Sparks (MacSparky) wrote an entire <a href=\"https://learn.macsparky.com/p/obsidianfg\">field guide about it</a>and The Sweet Setup offered a <a href=\"https://thesweetsetup.com/rm/obsidian-starter-vault/\">sample starter vault</a>. Since the guide was expensive and the sample vault was free, I naturally started there. I <a href=\"https://obsidian.md/download\">downloaded Obsidian</a> and figured out how to access my new files.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-starter-vault\">A Starter Vault</h2>\n<p>The Sweet Setup&rsquo;s Starter Vault includes articles about common Obsidian use cases like journaling. It provides instructions on how to download, install, and configure community plugins, and how to integrate them with the core plugins that come built-in, like the daily note plugin. My journaling habit and my use of the <a href=\"https://github.com/chhoumann/quickadd\">Quick Add plugin</a> began on day one thanks to this resource.</p>\n<p>While other demo vaults are available, I recommend waiting a bit before exploring them. This gives you time to familiarize yourself with your own setup before adopting someone else&rsquo;s system. Some notable ones include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Ellane W. <a href=\"https://miscellaneplans.gumroad.com/l/planner-vault\">Obsidian Demo Vault</a> Ellane is a strong advocate for plain text within the Obsidian community. I&rsquo;ve interacted with her on Mastodon: <a href=\"https://micro.blog/ellane@pkm.social\">@ellane@pkm.social</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://store.sascha-kasper.com/l/obvault?layout=profile\">The Lean Productivity Starter Vault</a> This vault by Sascha Kasper is comprehensive, covering organization, metadata, templates, core and community plugins, and even CSS snippets.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"youtube\">YouTube</h2>\n<p>I realized early on that Obsidian has a steeper learning curve than most software, but there seemed to be ample resources to help. True to the 21st century, I turned to YouTube and stumbled upon the perfect beginner&rsquo;s video: Nick Milo&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbLb6QCK88&amp;t=311s\">Linking Your Thinking</a>. He has an entire beginner&rsquo;s series, but that first video truly explains the philosophy behind Obsidian. Two other YouTubers whose content I found particularly helpful were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/nicolevanderhoeven\">Nicole van der Hoeven</a>: A Senior Developer Advocate at Grafana Labs, Nicole shares about learning in public, note-taking, and other interesting topics. Her videos are conversational, mostly stay under 20 minutes, and demonstrate concepts clearly. You can follow her on Mastodon: <a href=\"https://micro.blog/nicole@pkm.social\">@nicole@pkm.social</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@FromSergio\">FromSergio</a> Though he no longer produces Obsidian videos, Portuguese YouTuber Sergio&rsquo;s past content is excellent. Like Nicole, his videos are short, to the point, and easy to understand.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other YouTubers I enjoy include <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@DannyHatcherTech\">Danny Hatcher,</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbsAQSIKQXk&amp;t=3s%5D\">No BoilerPlate,</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@DannBerg\">Dann Berg</a>, who also has a blog linked from his YouTube page.</p>\n<h2 id=\"communities\">Communities</h2>\n<p>Obsidian users gather in three main online spaces:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/\">Reddit</a> With over 126,000 members, r/ObsidianMD is a massive subreddit. Be ready for the deluge of graph screenshots, but it&rsquo;s also a helpful place to ask questions, stay updated on plugins, and interact with the community. Obsidian&rsquo;s CEO, u/kepano, even moderates and interacts with users there.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.obsidian.md\">Official Obsidian Forum</a> This is the best place to go when you&rsquo;re stumped by a problem. I&rsquo;ve always received an answer to my questions here. Superuser holroy even wrote me a working DataView query on the first try!</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/obsidianmd\">Obsidian Members Group on Discord</a> A huge and somewhat chaotic space. Many plugin developers hang out here.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"websites\">Websites</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://obsidian.rocks/\">Obsidian Rocks</a> is the product of Tim Miller (@WebInspectInc on Twitter). I finally got the courage to use the complicated and powerful Linter plugin after reading Tim&rsquo;s article on it - <a href=\"https://obsidian.rocks/automate-your-notes-with-obsidian-linter/\">Automate Your Notes With Obsidian Linter.</a> Another helpful article was <a href=\"https://obsidian.rocks/obsidian-mobile-five-tips-for-success/\">Obsidian Mobile: Five Tips for Success</a>, which helped me configure my iPhone settings so that I had many fewer problems. There are plenty of other articles on Obsidian Rocks on all facets of the apps use and I encourage you to check them out.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://beingpax.medium.com/\">Prakash Joshi Pax on Medium</a> - One of the most helpful articles on Obsidian that I&rsquo;ve ever read came from this site, <a href=\"https://archive.ph/zsLRD\">Obsidian Templater Snippets I Wish I Knew Sooner</a>.(Note: I link to Medium articles through archive.ph to avoid the paywall). There is new material being added regularly and it&rsquo;s worth bookmarking and checking back. Pax also has a newsletter worth reading and he occasionally makes videos.</p>\n<p>I guess I would be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t plug <a href=\"https://obsidian.amerpie.lol/\">my Obsidian &ldquo;how to&rdquo; articles.</a> I&rsquo;ve written about plugins, backup, vault structure and more. I also answer questions as best I can. My whole career has been helping people with technology issues and I still enjoy it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"newsletters\">Newsletters</h2>\n<p>Aidan Helfant has a website, YouTube channel and a podcast about Obsidian, geared towards students but helpful for all Obsidian beginners. I <a href=\"https://www.aidanhelfant.com/newsletter/\">subscribe to his newsletter</a> and find value in it.</p>\n<p>Mike Schmitz has a website, <a href=\"https://www.obsidianuniversity.com/\">Obsidian University</a> where you can subscribe to his newsletter, download a starter vault or sign up for his (paid) Obsidian class. I got a lot out of his material, especially his video on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DUUbRWeeRg\">configuring Obsidian&rsquo;s settings</a>.</p>\n",

My subscription auto-renewed annually without much thought.\n\nWithin a few years, it became clear that staying at home full-time wasn't for me. Through connections, I landed a relaxed role in the IT department at a small, private university in my hometown. It's the perfect post-retirement job: I enjoy helping faculty, staff, and students with their tech problems without the headaches of being on-call, budgeting, or strategic planning.\n\nAround that time, I noticed an unfamiliar program, Obsidian, gaining popularity among the tech circles I used to follow. David Sparks (MacSparky) wrote an entire [field guide about it](https://learn.macsparky.com/p/obsidianfg)and The Sweet Setup offered a [sample starter vault](https://thesweetsetup.com/rm/obsidian-starter-vault/). Since the guide was expensive and the sample vault was free, I naturally started there. I [downloaded Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/download) and figured out how to access my new files.\n\n## A Starter Vault\n\nThe Sweet Setup's Starter Vault includes articles about common Obsidian use cases like journaling. It provides instructions on how to download, install, and configure community plugins, and how to integrate them with the core plugins that come built-in, like the daily note plugin. My journaling habit and my use of the [Quick Add plugin](https://github.com/chhoumann/quickadd) began on day one thanks to this resource.\n\nWhile other demo vaults are available, I recommend waiting a bit before exploring them. This gives you time to familiarize yourself with your own setup before adopting someone else's system. Some notable ones include:\n\n- The Ellane W. [Obsidian Demo Vault](https://miscellaneplans.gumroad.com/l/planner-vault) Ellane is a strong advocate for plain text within the Obsidian community. I've interacted with her on Mastodon: [@ellane@pkm.social](https://micro.blog/ellane@pkm.social)\n- [The Lean Productivity Starter Vault](https://store.sascha-kasper.com/l/obvault?layout=profile) This vault by Sascha Kasper is comprehensive, covering organization, metadata, templates, core and community plugins, and even CSS snippets.\n\n## YouTube\n\nI realized early on that Obsidian has a steeper learning curve than most software, but there seemed to be ample resources to help. True to the 21st century, I turned to YouTube and stumbled upon the perfect beginner's video: Nick Milo's [Linking Your Thinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbLb6QCK88&t=311s). He has an entire beginner's series, but that first video truly explains the philosophy behind Obsidian. Two other YouTubers whose content I found particularly helpful were:\n\n- [Nicole van der Hoeven](https://www.youtube.com/c/nicolevanderhoeven): A Senior Developer Advocate at Grafana Labs, Nicole shares about learning in public, note-taking, and other interesting topics. Her videos are conversational, mostly stay under 20 minutes, and demonstrate concepts clearly. You can follow her on Mastodon: [@nicole@pkm.social](https://micro.blog/nicole@pkm.social)\n- [FromSergio](https://www.youtube.com/@FromSergio) Though he no longer produces Obsidian videos, Portuguese YouTuber Sergio's past content is excellent. Like Nicole, his videos are short, to the point, and easy to understand.\n\nOther YouTubers I enjoy include [Danny Hatcher,](https://www.youtube.com/@DannyHatcherTech) [No BoilerPlate,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbsAQSIKQXk&t=3s]), and [Dann Berg](https://www.youtube.com/@DannBerg), who also has a blog linked from his YouTube page.\n\n## Communities\n\nObsidian users gather in three main online spaces:\n\n- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/) With over 126,000 members, r/ObsidianMD is a massive subreddit. Be ready for the deluge of graph screenshots, but it's also a helpful place to ask questions, stay updated on plugins, and interact with the community. Obsidian's CEO, u/kepano, even moderates and interacts with users there.\n- [Official Obsidian Forum](https://forum.obsidian.md) This is the best place to go when you're stumped by a problem. I've always received an answer to my questions here. Superuser holroy even wrote me a working DataView query on the first try!\n- [Obsidian Members Group on Discord](https://discord.com/invite/obsidianmd) A huge and somewhat chaotic space. Many plugin developers hang out here.\n\n## Websites\n\n[Obsidian Rocks](https://obsidian.rocks/) is the product of Tim Miller (@WebInspectInc on Twitter). I finally got the courage to use the complicated and powerful Linter plugin after reading Tim's article on it - [Automate Your Notes With Obsidian Linter.](https://obsidian.rocks/automate-your-notes-with-obsidian-linter/) Another helpful article was [Obsidian Mobile: Five Tips for Success](https://obsidian.rocks/obsidian-mobile-five-tips-for-success/), which helped me configure my iPhone settings so that I had many fewer problems. There are plenty of other articles on Obsidian Rocks on all facets of the apps use and I encourage you to check them out.\n\n[Prakash Joshi Pax on Medium](https://beingpax.medium.com/) - One of the most helpful articles on Obsidian that I've ever read came from this site, [Obsidian Templater Snippets I Wish I Knew Sooner](https://archive.ph/zsLRD).(Note: I link to Medium articles through archive.ph to avoid the paywall). There is new material being added regularly and it's worth bookmarking and checking back. Pax also has a newsletter worth reading and he occasionally makes videos.\n\nI guess I would be remiss if I didn't plug [my Obsidian \"how to\" articles.](https://obsidian.amerpie.lol/) I've written about plugins, backup, vault structure and more. I also answer questions as best I can. My whole career has been helping people with technology issues and I still enjoy it.\n\n## Newsletters\n\nAidan Helfant has a website, YouTube channel and a podcast about Obsidian, geared towards students but helpful for all Obsidian beginners. I [subscribe to his newsletter](https://www.aidanhelfant.com/newsletter/) and find value in it.\n\nMike Schmitz has a website, [Obsidian University](https://www.obsidianuniversity.com/) where you can subscribe to his newsletter, download a starter vault or sign up for his (paid) Obsidian class. I got a lot out of his material, especially his video on [configuring Obsidian's settings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DUUbRWeeRg).\n",

One day it will get too unwieldy, and I&rsquo;ll have to pare it down or start a volume two or something, but for now it&rsquo;s there to explore.

My uber original name for this feature is (drumroll) [This Week's Bookmarks.](https://amerpie.lol/2024/03/09/this-weeks-bookmarks.html)\n\nI subscribe to way too many newsletters and what keeps me interested in them is looking for the link of the day. Ironically, some of what I subscribe too are other people's weekly link posts! I'll share anything that looks like it might catch the eye of a curious person. It could be a story about the [world's coolest streets](https://www.timeout.com/things-to-do/coolest-streets-in-the-world) or something funny like the Washington Post's collection of [one-star reviews of National Parks.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2024/02/21/national-parks-one-star-reviews/) I rarely share news stories. I aim for something with a little shelf life. I'm a techie and a blogger so there's plenty of stuff there for like-minded folks.\n\nRight now, I'm keeping [a running list of several week's worth of links](https://amerpie.lol/my-bookmarks/). One day it will get too unwieldy, and I'll have to pare it down or start a volume two or something, but for now it's there to explore. If you check it out and find anything useful or entertaining it would mean the world to me if you let me know.\n\nMatthias Ott, author of the wonderful newsletter [Own Your Web](https://buttondown.email/ownyourweb/archive/issue-10/), [wrote a piece](https://matthiasott.com/notes/links-worth-sharing) recently about all the reasons why creating a links page is an integral part of the IndieWeb. He listed different ways to share your finds (like newsletters and RSS feeds) and he gave multiple reasons for collecting links in the first place. He's the inspiration for this reflection. \n\nA couple of bloggers I like have weekly links posts or newsletters. Check out the HeyDingus [Seven Things This Week](https://heydingus.net/blog/2024/3/7-things-this-week-135) collection and let the writer, Jarrod Blundy know that I sent you. While you're at it, look at Ian Betteridge's new [10 Blue Links](https://ianbetteridge.com/2024/03/08/ten-blue-links-too-much-apple-edition/) which he'll be happy to email you each week.\n\nPeace!

Whether you rely on the Dataview plugin or embedded queries, properties play a vital role.

Luckily, there are three powerful plugins that can streamline your metadata management in Obsidian: <a href=\"https://github.com/platers/obsidian-linter\">Linter</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/mdelobelle/metadatamenu\">Metadata Menu</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/fez-github/obsidian-multi-properties\">Multi Properties</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"linter-pluginstreamline-your-defaults\">Linter Plugin—Streamline Your Defaults</h2>\n<p>Among the trio, Linter stands out as the most robust plugin. With enough customization, it can accomplish what the other two plugins offer. However, I prefer using Linter for general defaults while using the other plugins for specific cases. Linter excels at applying a default set of properties to all your notes, and I use the following essential properties:</p>\n<pre><code>&gt;```\ntitle:\nurl:\ntags:\ncreation date:\nmodification date:\n```\n</code></pre>\n<p>Furthermore, Linter offers the flexibility of adding additional properties, which it conveniently lists in alphabetical order. You can also choose the date format, with the recommended format being YYYY-MM-DD. Another impressive feature of Linter is its ability to move tags from the note body to the metadata section.

Whether you want to group notes within a folder or classify them by a common tag, this plugin offers remarkable flexibility. While the Templater plugin can achieve similar functionality, Metadata Menu eliminates the need to learn special syntax. It&rsquo;s worth noting that Templater can be less reliable on Mac systems. To learn more about how to leverage Metadata Menu effectively, check out <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOw_LtMgMlQ\">Marco Serafini&rsquo;s YouTube video</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"multi-propertiesquick-and-easy\">Multi Properties—Quick and Easy</h2>\n<p>If you need a quick and effortless method to add properties on the go, the Multi Properties plugin is your go-to solution.

				"title": "Microsoft Edge Really Doesn't Suck",
				"content_html": "<p><img src=\"https://amerpie.micro.blog/uploads/2024/001-what-is-microsoft-edge-.jpeg\" alt=\"Microsoft Edge Logo\"></p>\n<p>Last year, the small private university where I work purchased new laptops for the staff and I was charged with deploying them, a process that had me visiting over a hundred employee to help them back up and migrate their documents and settings, Including browser bookmarks. One of the first questions I asked each person was &ldquo;What browser do you use?&rdquo; Almost all of them told me Google Chrome. A few holdouts used Firefox and only one or two named Edge&hellip;and they weren&rsquo;t the power users if you know what I mean.</p>\n<p>I came to work at the university after being retired from the public school system for a couple of years. During my career I primarily supported Macs and I&rsquo;d used one myself since the days of OS 9. This was my first extended experience working in a Microsoft centric environment. There are a few Macs on campus but overwhelmingly our users are PC based. When I started, I was assigned a Dell AIO desktop with Windows 10. I intuited that Edge had good integration with Microsoft 365, so I chose to use it despite having been primarily a Safari and Chrome user in the past. I can use any browser I want. My coworkers in the IT department use Brave, Firefox and Chrome but after my initial choice I&rsquo;ve decided to stick with Edge and have in fact made it my default browser on my iPhone and my new M2 MacBook Air.</p>\n<p>Why, you ask? Because despite what the world seems to believe, Edge really doesn&rsquo;t suck. In fact, it&rsquo;s variety of features make it one of my favorite pieces of software to use. Is it perfect? No. Like most Chromium based browsers it&rsquo;s a memory hog. As a heavy user of Apple&rsquo;s Shortcuts app on my phone and Mac, I find that most browser related workflows are written for Safari and don&rsquo;t work as well in Edge. Still, the good overwhelmingly outweighs the bad. Edge has quite a few features that are cutting edge, if not unique.</p>\n<h2 id=\"profiles\">Profiles</h2>\n<p>I have separate profiles for home and work. At work Edge, when signed into Microsoft 365 is managed, meaning I can install no extensions and save no passwords, but I do have ready access to all my documents in OneDrive, my Outlook email accounts our campus Intranet and more. I have a set of work-related bookmarks I use with this profile. I simultaneously open another browser window signed into a different Microsoft account and voila, I then have access to all my extensions, a different set of bookmarks and my bookmark manager of choice, <a href=\"https://www.lastpass.com/\">LastPass</a>, which also holds my credit card info in case I need to buy anything through the browser. I use the same personal profile at home so I can save things I want to reference at work in my extra browser window.</p>\n<h2 id=\"workspaces\">Workspaces</h2>\n<p>Within a profile, users can create collections, browser setups for unique use cases. I have one for general browsing with my go to collection of bookmarks in the bookmark (or favorites as Edge calls them) bar. I have another setup for blogging with a different set of bookmarks available in the bookmarks bar. Both workspaces share the same general set of bookmarks from the menu bar or toolbar button, so I don&rsquo;t have to worry about syncing two collections. Tabs can be set to be remembered between sessions, so when I&rsquo;m ready to work on a blog entry, I have tabs for <a href=\"https://micro.blog/\">Micro.blog</a> <a href=\"https://home.omg.lol/\">omg.lol</a>, and my <a href=\"https://social.lol/@amerpie\">Mastodon account</a>. It&rsquo;s all really handy and allows me to just open up the browser and go to work.</p>\n<h2 id=\"extensions\">Extensions</h2>\n<p>Edge can use the same extensions available to Google Chrome and there&rsquo;s a vast selection to choose from. I don&rsquo;t find that running all the extensions I need slows Edge down appreciably, so I install what I need. Extensions are specific to the profile you are using, but workspaces within the same profile share the same extensions. You can create a different Mac and PC profile is you find yourself using extensions that are platform specific. Here&rsquo;s what I use:\n.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://omnivore.app/\">Omnivore</a> - It&rsquo;s the best read it later service around these days, featuring a mobile app with read aloud capability, newsletter subscription service, RSS feeds and a browser extension.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.obsidian.md/t/markdownload-markdown-web-clipper/173\">Obsidian Web Clipper</a> - I primarily use a <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/extratone/7a881fff3c9472f607c4730be08b1c87\">bookmarklet</a> for saving web content into <a href=\"https://getdrafts.com/\">Drafts</a> on my Mac, but I use a different vault at work on my PC where Drafts isn&rsquo;t available.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://app.raindrop.io/\">Raindrop.io</a> - I have a subscription and heartily endorse Raindrop.io for it&rsquo;s cross platform support as well as it&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://evernote.com/\">Evernote</a> and <a href=\"https://ifttt.com/raindrop\">IFTTT</a> integration which really helps me when I&rsquo;m researching anything</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://obsidian.md/\">Aboard</a> - This is the extension for the app my wife and I use to share links with each other. When I find an app, a TV show, a news story or whatever, I put it into Aboard and she gets a notification and can check it out when she has time. It&rsquo;s free and useful.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://remotedesktop.google.com/\">Chrome Remote Desktop</a> - This allows me to access my home computer from other locations. It&rsquo;s free, easy to set up and use and reliable. I don&rsquo;t know what people pay for <a href=\"https://www.edovia.com/en/screens/\">Screens</a> or <a href=\"https://www.teamviewer.com/en/\">TeamViewer</a> subscriptions.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm\">UBlock Origin</a>- The best ad blocker on the planet. 31,000,000 downloads can&rsquo;t be wrong.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.gettoby.com/\">Toby</a> - My new tab extension. It makes it easy to save and open windows full of tabs on the go. I use the free version and even though I maintain my <a href=\"https://start.me/\">start.me</a> page, I stick with Toby for new tabs.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/velja/gpipdgcamiclkcomcnogmlfpalggmcmk\">Velja</a> - Works in conjunction with the Mac app of the same name to open URLs in other bowsers and apps (e.g., Slack, Teams, Zoom, Freetube etc)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"collections\">Collections</h2>\n<p>One of the features in Edge I find really useful is available on the desktop and mobile version of the browser. You can create collections of bookmarks on the fly for things you want to investigate later but don&rsquo;t necessarily want to save forever. I have five collections:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Shopping</strong> - this is mostly a collection of Amazon pages I can keep separate from my Amazon wish list so my wife can&rsquo;t see what I was thinking of getting her for her birthday</li>\n<li><strong>Software</strong> - I&rsquo;m an unembarrassed software nerd, always looking for the latest cool program to try out. I keep a running collection of pages of programs I want to look at.</li>\n<li><strong>Windows</strong> - Most of my leisure browsing happens on my mac, but when I find something that might be useful on my day job, I save it to my Windows collection to investigate at work</li>\n<li><strong>TV</strong> - When I come across a review of an upcoming television show, I add it to this collection. Once a week I read all the emails from streaming services and the web pages I&rsquo;ve collected and i cultivate the viewing list for my wife and I</li>\n<li><strong>Reading List</strong> - I use a read it later app (Omnivore) but sometimes I just add a news article or How-to guide to my reading list collection if it&rsquo;s something I know I&rsquo;ll just read in my browser.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"other-features-i-like\">Other features I like</h2>\n<p>As I mentioned earlier, one of the best kept secrets of using a computer in 2024 is the free access to Chat-GPT4 built into <a href=\"https://copilot.microsoft.com/\">Bing/CoPilot</a>. There are people out there paying $20 a month to do what they can do for free with CoPilot and it&rsquo;s built right into Edge. I personally have an API subscription to Open.AI, which runs me about a dollar a month so I can use the API key in other apps like Raycast and Obsidian.</p>\n<p>The mobile version of Edge is good enough to be my default browser in iOS 17. Edge has a feature to send tabs to other devices and I use it all the time between my work computer, phone and MacBook at home.

				"content_text": "\n![Microsoft Edge Logo](https://amerpie.micro.blog/uploads/2024/001-what-is-microsoft-edge-.jpeg)\n\nLast year, the small private university where I work purchased new laptops for the staff and I was charged with deploying them, a process that had me visiting over a hundred employee to help them back up and migrate their documents and settings, Including browser bookmarks. One of the first questions I asked each person was \"What browser do you use?\" Almost all of them told me Google Chrome. A few holdouts used Firefox and only one or two named Edge...and they weren't the power users if you know what I mean.\n\nI came to work at the university after being retired from the public school system for a couple of years. During my career I primarily supported Macs and I'd used one myself since the days of OS 9. This was my first extended experience working in a Microsoft centric environment. There are a few Macs on campus but overwhelmingly our users are PC based. When I started, I was assigned a Dell AIO desktop with Windows 10. I intuited that Edge had good integration with Microsoft 365, so I chose to use it despite having been primarily a Safari and Chrome user in the past. I can use any browser I want. My coworkers in the IT department use Brave, Firefox and Chrome but after my initial choice I've decided to stick with Edge and have in fact made it my default browser on my iPhone and my new M2 MacBook Air.\n\nWhy, you ask? Because despite what the world seems to believe, Edge really doesn't suck. In fact, it's variety of features make it one of my favorite pieces of software to use. Is it perfect? No. Like most Chromium based browsers it's a memory hog. As a heavy user of Apple's Shortcuts app on my phone and Mac, I find that most browser related workflows are written for Safari and don't work as well in Edge. Still, the good overwhelmingly outweighs the bad. Edge has quite a few features that are cutting edge, if not unique.\n\n## Profiles\n\nI have separate profiles for home and work. At work Edge, when signed into Microsoft 365 is managed, meaning I can install no extensions and save no passwords, but I do have ready access to all my documents in OneDrive, my Outlook email accounts our campus Intranet and more. I have a set of work-related bookmarks I use with this profile. I simultaneously open another browser window signed into a different Microsoft account and voila, I then have access to all my extensions, a different set of bookmarks and my bookmark manager of choice, [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/), which also holds my credit card info in case I need to buy anything through the browser. I use the same personal profile at home so I can save things I want to reference at work in my extra browser window.\n\n## Workspaces\n\nWithin a profile, users can create collections, browser setups for unique use cases. I have one for general browsing with my go to collection of bookmarks in the bookmark (or favorites as Edge calls them) bar. I have another setup for blogging with a different set of bookmarks available in the bookmarks bar. Both workspaces share the same general set of bookmarks from the menu bar or toolbar button, so I don't have to worry about syncing two collections. Tabs can be set to be remembered between sessions, so when I'm ready to work on a blog entry, I have tabs for [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/) [omg.lol](https://home.omg.lol/), and my [Mastodon account](https://social.lol/@amerpie). It's all really handy and allows me to just open up the browser and go to work.\n\n## Extensions\n\nEdge can use the same extensions available to Google Chrome and there's a vast selection to choose from. I don't find that running all the extensions I need slows Edge down appreciably, so I install what I need. Extensions are specific to the profile you are using, but workspaces within the same profile share the same extensions. You can create a different Mac and PC profile is you find yourself using extensions that are platform specific. Here's what I use:\n.\n- [Omnivore](https://omnivore.app/) - It's the best read it later service around these days, featuring a mobile app with read aloud capability, newsletter subscription service, RSS feeds and a browser extension.\n- [Obsidian Web Clipper](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/markdownload-markdown-web-clipper/173) - I primarily use a [bookmarklet](https://gist.github.com/extratone/7a881fff3c9472f607c4730be08b1c87) for saving web content into [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/) on my Mac, but I use a different vault at work on my PC where Drafts isn't available.\n- [Raindrop.io](https://app.raindrop.io/) - I have a subscription and heartily endorse Raindrop.io for it's cross platform support as well as it's [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) and [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/raindrop) integration which really helps me when I'm researching anything\n- [Aboard](https://obsidian.md/) - This is the extension for the app my wife and I use to share links with each other. When I find an app, a TV show, a news story or whatever, I put it into Aboard and she gets a notification and can check it out when she has time. It's free and useful.\n- [Chrome Remote Desktop](https://remotedesktop.google.com/) - This allows me to access my home computer from other locations. It's free, easy to set up and use and reliable. I don't know what people pay for [Screens](https://www.edovia.com/en/screens/) or [TeamViewer](https://www.teamviewer.com/en/) subscriptions.\n- [UBlock Origin](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm)- The best ad blocker on the planet. 31,000,000 downloads can't be wrong.\n- [Toby](https://www.gettoby.com/) - My new tab extension. It makes it easy to save and open windows full of tabs on the go. I use the free version and even though I maintain my [start.me](https://start.me/) page, I stick with Toby for new tabs.\n- [Velja](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/velja/gpipdgcamiclkcomcnogmlfpalggmcmk) - Works in conjunction with the Mac app of the same name to open URLs in other bowsers and apps (e.g., Slack, Teams, Zoom, Freetube etc)\n\n## Collections\n\nOne of the features in Edge I find really useful is available on the desktop and mobile version of the browser. You can create collections of bookmarks on the fly for things you want to investigate later but don't necessarily want to save forever. I have five collections:\n\n- **Shopping** - this is mostly a collection of Amazon pages I can keep separate from my Amazon wish list so my wife can't see what I was thinking of getting her for her birthday\n- **Software** - I'm an unembarrassed software nerd, always looking for the latest cool program to try out. I keep a running collection of pages of programs I want to look at.\n- **Windows** - Most of my leisure browsing happens on my mac, but when I find something that might be useful on my day job, I save it to my Windows collection to investigate at work\n- **TV** - When I come across a review of an upcoming television show, I add it to this collection. Once a week I read all the emails from streaming services and the web pages I've collected and i cultivate the viewing list for my wife and I\n- **Reading List** - I use a read it later app (Omnivore) but sometimes I just add a news article or How-to guide to my reading list collection if it's something I know I'll just read in my browser.\n\n## Other features I like\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, one of the best kept secrets of using a computer in 2024 is the free access to Chat-GPT4 built into [Bing/CoPilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/). There are people out there paying $20 a month to do what they can do for free with CoPilot and it's built right into Edge. I personally have an API subscription to Open.AI, which runs me about a dollar a month so I can use the API key in other apps like Raycast and Obsidian.\n\nThe mobile version of Edge is good enough to be my default browser in iOS 17. Edge has a feature to send tabs to other devices and I use it all the time between my work computer, phone and MacBook at home. I have full access to my browser bookmarks on my phone as well as my history. Since I use a password manager for passwords, I don't worry about browser saved passwords.\n\nI know that Safari introduced profiles last year with the release of Sonoma and I know Chrome has access to the same browser extensions, but I just find that in my environment - Windows at work, Mac at home and consistent iPhone use, Edge has a set of features that work reliably for me. The browser receives constant updates and allows users to download separate beta and canary versions if they want. Hopefully you've found something in this review that might give you a reason to give Edge a tryout.\n\n\n\n",
