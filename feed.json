I believe that to be true most of the time. I'm always on the lookout for nice people. Thinking about them is a tool I use in my personal gratitude practice, a daily exercise where I record three things I'm grateful for. I have been doing it for years. There's never been a time in my life when I couldn't find some folks with kindness in their heart. Even during the years when I worked as a prison guard, there were inmates who did kind things in a non-manipulative way. I used to drink coffee continually on that job. You could buy a packet of Taster's Choice in the canteen for a dime in those days. An old con who cleaned the area around my desk gave me some sage advice one day. \"Mr Plummer,\" he said, \"Don't ever put that coffee cup down and turn your back on it. These boys will spit in it if you do.\" It's been almost 40 years since he told me that and I still remember him for saving me from that indignity.</p>\n<p>During the years I worked as an IT tech in the school system, I would always be showered with gifts at Christmas. Teachers would bring me baked goods, iTunes gift cards, coupon books, CDs and more. With all that teaching involves, remembering the guy who comes around once in a while to look at your laptop takes some real effort. When I took a mid-career break to get married and go hiking for six months, many of those teachers send care packages to my wife and I with edible treats, socks, bug spray and other things from our wish list.</p>\n<p>People with demanding, public facing jobs who maintain their cool and make others feel welcome have a special gift. The wait staff at my favorite diner, even when they are slammed, still acknowledge their regulars. They are still nice and patient with kids. They take a minute to crack jokes and to make fun of me for always ordering the same thing.</p>\n<p>So many of the tools I've learned to love on my computer are apps that some developer has made and given away for free. Everything I know about creating a blog is a result of freely distributed guides and tutorials.  The number of letters I've gotten from complete strangers on the Internet to thank me for something or to encourage me or to praise me is just astounding. People will go out of their way just to make someone else feel good and I think that is awesome. Yes, I have also experienced some meanness online but it's overshadowed by kindness.</p>\n<p>I think often about some of the giants I have know who dedicated their lives to the social justice movement. I know men and women who worked in the deep south during the Civil Rights era at great danger to themselves. I know organizers who survived the 1979 Greensboro Massacre who are still committed to the cause of helping poor people. I know union workers who've left home to travel to other areas to help organize workers so that they might enjoy the same benefits. I know soldiers who, sickened by war, laid down their rifles to speak out to try and stop the senseless killing that our government asked them to do in the nebulous name of freedom.</p>\n<p>Look for kind people today. Better yet, be kind. Get your name added to someone's gratitude list.\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

One thing it doesn&#39;t do is\ncontrol items that launch in the background.</p>\n\n<p>Today I found an app that does a good job with that aspect of app\nmanagement. Coincidentally, it&#39;s also called <a\nhref=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/startup-manager/id1296723195?mt=12\">Startup\nManager</a>, but it&#39;s a totally different app by a different developer,\nSystweak Software (Shrishail Rana). Where it shines is in telling you\nall the apps that you have installed that have background processes,\neven if they are disabled. In the system settings for macOS, some\nbackground processes are identified by the name of the developer rather\nthan the name of the app, making it confusing to sort out what you are\ntrying to control. Startup Manager identifies all the processes using\nthe name of the associated app.</p>\n\n<p>The recently updated app (September 2024) provides information on\nbrowser extensions, Kernel extensions, Launch items, Library inserts,\nLogin items, and Spotlight importers. In the login items, launch items\nand browser plugins categories you can enable/disable each item, delete\nit, get information about it and see where it&#39;s located in the Finder.</p>\n\n<p>By default, Apple&#39;s applications are not shown, but you can toggle them\non if desired.</p>\n\n<p>Startup manager is free and can ve downloaded in the <a\nhref=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/startup-manager/id1296723195?mt=12\">Mac\nApp Store.</a><br /></p>\n\n<figure class=\"attachment attachment--preview flex-col justify-center attachment--jpg\">\n      <img class=\"lightbox--image\" srcset=\"https://scribbles.page/rails/active_storage/representations/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBbXFtIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--e10dec0eaf20ebc68aa9d23563fcf5c6ef6a00c4/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDRG9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJYW5CbkJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFJQUVHa0NBQXc2Q25OaGRtVnlld2M2Q25OMGNtbHdWRG9NY1hWaGJHbDBlV2xrIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJ2YXJpYXRpb24ifX0=--95bb9764b8481bddaaffec4af57d9e494bae5163/CleanShot%202024-10-28%20at%2018.22.00@2x.jpg 2x\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Apple System Setting Interface\" src=\"https://scribbles.page/rails/active_storage/representations/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBbXFtIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--e10dec0eaf20ebc68aa9d23563fcf5c6ef6a00c4/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDRG9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJYW5CbkJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFJQUNHa0NBQVk2Q25OaGRtVnlld2M2Q25OMGNtbHdWRG9NY1hWaGJHbDBlV2xrIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJ2YXJpYXRpb24ifX0=--daf4078a1aefa3c961be2c7b8fbe4a74a2641c0c/CleanShot%202024-10-28%20at%2018.22.00@2x.jpg\" />\n    <figcaption class=\"attachment__caption text-center\">\n      Apple System Setting Interface\n    </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=A Different App for Managing Background Items' style='text-decoration: underline'>‚úâÔ∏è Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/life-cycle.webp\" alt=\"Silhouettes depict stages of human life: a baby lying, a toddler crawling, a child walking, a teenager striding, an adult strolling, and an elder using a cane, against a plain background.\" /></p>\n<p>I'm turning 60 in a few months and though I wouldn't say it's messing with my head in any kind of negative way, it has prompted me to think about aging and mortality more than I have in the past. It's so weird to be getting ready to start my seventh decade on earth while simultaneously being able to recall events from the past as if they happened yesterday. In some ways, it is almost inconceivable that high school happened 40+ years ago. I had dinner with my brother (58) and sister (56) the other night along with my mother (77) and we were recalling events from growing up as if they just happened last week.</p>\n<p>I've been going gray for years. Not only that, but I wear a full beard and it is 100% white. Wonder Woman told me today that one of our grandkids said to her recently, \"Nana you might be old, but at least you're not as old as Papa.\" For the record, we are less than two years apart. Still, there has been more than one occasion when we've eaten together, and they've extended a senior discount to me (I'm not old enough) and not to her. Sometimes I feel like I'm in a Sci-fi novel, married to an immortal who doesn't age. She was furious when Kamala Harris first named Tim Walz as her running mate because she thought he was just another old white man. Once she found out that Kamala and Tim are are the same age that he is cool AF, she calmed down.</p>\n<p>I charged full steam ahead through my 40s and early 50s, hiking the Appalachian Trail and completing 83 century rides on my bicycle. I thought I'd be going like that for decades until arthritis brought me to a screeching halt and I had to have both knees replaced. Plenty of people go on to have very active lives after that surgery, so there is still hope that I'll get some of that mojo back. My mom walked across England and hiked the Camino de Santiago in Spain in her 70s.</p>\n<p>Our oldest grandchildren have graduated from high school now. It won't be long before we are great-grandparents. It's funny because all of my siblings, none of whom got married or had kids early like me, all have children the same ages as my grandchildren. I grumbled for years that I didn't like kids, but it was all a facade. I worked in primary and elementary schools for two decades, and being a grandparent has been one of the best experiences of my life.</p>\n<p>I'm trying to be OK with the fact that I don't feel like my time on earth is unlimited like I have for most of my life. Not being a religious person, there are no thoughts of an afterlife. Every time I do something unhealthy, I immediately have the thought that I'm robbing myself of time. I wish I could say that I am them immediately motivated to then eat some spinach and power walk around the block, but so far that has not been the effect.</p>\n<p>I have got to say that I enjoy having been around enough to be retired from my career job. It's cool going to work these days because I want to, not because I have to. I could stop at any time. That's pretty empowering. It makes the crappy days that inevitably happen at work more bearable. I'm not even the oldest person in my office. Our database manager is three years my senior, and she takes no shit from anyone. She's my role model.</p>\n<p>I can accept my eyes getting weaker and my gait getting slower. As far as I can tell, my mind isn't slipping yet. Both my parents are still alive, so family history indicates that I probably have quite a few years left. I hope so. There is so much more to write about.\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

I was a wee bit busy this weekend being a supportive husband and was away from my computer)</p>\n<p>I often make the comment on Reddit or Mastodon that Obsidian, a cross-platform note-taking application, is my favorite piece of software since Netscape Navigator 2, the browser that practically everyone used when we transitioned from AOL and CompuServe to the real Internet back in the 90s. Back then, we discovered new and interesting web pages daily. The Internet was full of hastily constructed and esoteric material, and it all seemed so magical. For our whole lives, we'd had to wait until 10 past the hour for the radio to give us a weather forecast, and now we could use this marvelous piece of software to go to weather.com whenever we were curious. It was revolutionary and amazing, and it took a while to get used to.</p>\n<p>Eventually we did get used to it, along with all the other marvels over the past nearly 30 years. I find myself quite jaded sometimes. The computer I carry in my pocket can do almost anything, and I'm still referring to it as a phone, the same name I used for the hard-wired wall mounted rotary dialed device at my grandmother's house. I no longer marvel at being able to do my Christmas shopping from my couch or following a baseball game pitch by pitch, knowing the speed of every thrown ball and the batting average of every hitter right up to that at bat.</p>\n<p>I experienced an Internet revival late last year. After an aborted attempt to retire early, I'd lost interest in keeping up with technology. I quit following the news, stopped downloading software and spent hours scrolling trash subreddits like \"Am I the Asshole\". Out of desperation, I went back to work to have something to do. Even though I went back into the IT field, I was still ambivalent. Instead of being on a Mac like I was used to, I was assigned a slow old Dell full of Microsoft software. It did not spark joy. Then one day I picked up my old iPad and for some reason launched my RSS reader. Many of the blog feeds were years old and dead, but some were still active. I started reading them, first from boredom and then with interest. People were talking about apps I'd never heard of. I cracked open my MacBook and started downloading updates for the OS and the hundreds of apps I'd collected over the years. It took a while.</p>\n<p>A British blogger, Robb Knight, had <a href='https://defaults.rknight.me/'>created a page where people were listing their default apps</a> in all kinds of categories. I wanted to get on the fun. I'd been working in the Apple/Mac/iOS space since the late 90s and except for the short break after retirement, I'd always been fascinated by software. In order to get added to Robb's site, <a href='https://obsidian.amerpie.lol/'>I had to start a blog</a>. I signed up at <a href='http://micro.blog/'>Micro.blog</a>, registered a domain and started writing. One app I saw mentioned over and over that I'd never used was Obsidian. It's free to download, and you can use it all you want without paying a dime unless you want to take advantage of their sync service, something I did a little later.</p>\n<p>I documented my learning process in Obsidian as it progressed. I'd download a plugin, watch a YouTube video, configure my setup, use it for a few days and then <a href='https://amerpie.lol/2024/03/06/my-dataview-use.html'>write a post for my blog</a>. I'd cross post it on Reddit and use a hashtag on Mastodon. I went for months living and breathing Obsidian. I started doing all my writing in it. I pimped out <a href='https://amerpie.lol/2024/03/29/my-daily-note.html'>the template for my daily note</a>, incorporating more and more of my life into it. I <a href='https://amerpie.lol/2024/02/04/how-to-send.html'>integrated key email messages</a> via IFTTT, Dropbox and Hazel. I <a href='https://amerpie.lol/2024/03/17/my-bookmark-workflow.html'>synced my bookmarks</a> from Raindrop.io. I started using Omnivore as my read it later service simply because <a href='https://amerpie.lol/2024/01/27/the-omnivore-to.html'>it automatically imports into Obsidian</a>. I started <a href='https://github.com/cyclelou/Amerpie'>my first GitHub repository</a> to share 500 Markdown notes containing my quotes collection. I managed to get Obsidian to do every single thing I'd once used Evernote for.</p>\n<p>Because of Obsidian, I've been able to learn to blog in the 21st century. I have four different blogs on three different platforms. I've got good notes and records and tens of thousands of words of web posts in my vault. Although I still write about the app occasionally, I've moved on to <a href='https://apps.louplummer.lol/'>writing reviews of other software</a> and even into <a href='https://louplummer.lol/'>non-technical writing</a>. It's amazing that something as simple as a plain text editor at its core has been at the center of my tech and real-life revival. It is so powerful and so extensible that it almost defies belief. The community around the app is generally helpful, supportive, curious and open. I've even interacted with the CEO of the company on social media.</p>\n<p>So, to the folks in whatever Bat Cave Obsidian is developed in, thank you for making such a wonderful tool. I owe you one.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/linkage/img_7907-1.webp\" alt=\"IMG_7907\" /></p>\n<p>I have been a dedicated newspaper reader since I was in the first grade in 1971. I did not limit myself to just the comics. I thought Dear Abby was fascinating and I always read the headlines on the front page. In North Carolina in the 1970s an infamous civil rights case was often featured. The Wilmington 10 was the name given to eight high school students, a minister from the United Church of Christ and an anti-poverty worker who had been caught up when the men were arrested for arson, following a bombing during racial unrest in the coastal town of Wilmington. The case was considered by many to be a travesty of justice from the very beginning. The convictions were based on eyewitness testimony from a mentally ill man who recanted during cross-examination and was banished from the courtroom. The other witness was given a motorcycle for his testimony. He too, later recanted.</p>\n<p>when the Soviet Union was accused by the United States of human rights violations, the Soviets used the Wilmington 10 as an example of American hypocrisy. After serving nearly a decade in prison, all of the convictions were overturned, and the state declined to re-prosecute.

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/ww2.webp\" alt=\"ww2\" /></p>\n<p>At 8:00 AM Saturday morning, Wonder Woman and about 70 others will begin running a 2.2-mile course over and over for 24 straight hours. Whoever covers the most distance in that time period will be declared the winner. Those completing 50k, 50 miles, 100k, 75 miles, and 100 miles will receive special awards. Some races are entrepreneurial money-making events for the organizers. Ironman, the titular sponsor of triathlons, is a for-profit company. The race Wonder Woman is in is a fundraiser. The money raised goes to an organization in the greater Williamsburg, VA area called The Arc. This is a wonderful inclusive organization offering programs to adults with developmental and intellectual disabilities.</p>\n<p>The name of the race is The Greensprings 24. The start/finish line and crew area (I'm crew) is at Jamestown High School. If you want to follow her, you can do it <a href='https://my.raceresult.com/314559/'>here.</a> Her race number is 204, and her actual name is Carol Plummer.</p>\n<p>I'll be set up in a pop-up off to the side with her supplies. I'll be in charge of filling bottles with both water and a liquid nutrition product called Tailwind. She has prepared packets of sports nutrition products that she will pick up every five laps or so. I have a small backpacking stove to heat up some real food for her to wolf down later in the day and through the night. It consists of things like plain white potatoes and soup. I'll be making coffee for us both.</p>\n<p>Today has been kind of ritualistic. We live about four hours away, so we had to travel and check into a hotel. She's stayed off her feet for the most part, although I did have to talk her out of going out and doing tourist things today. She has a more restless nature than I do! It's important that she stays extra hydrated today and that she eats some extra carbs. Her favorite pre-ultramarathon meal is pho, the Vietnamese rice noodle soup made with a salty and savory beef broth. She got into bed at 5:30 to read and hopefully doze off early. We will sleep as late as we can tomorrow before driving the 15 minutes to the racecourse in time to get the crew area set up.</p>\n<p>My duties will be pretty minimal. I'm mostly there as a cheerleader and motivator. If she gets blisters, I'll play medic, and as she gets progressively more tired, I'll help her with socks and shoe changes. I'll probably get yelled at a time or two. Ultramarathon runners are known for being grouchy crybabies sometimes because it's a terribly stressful sport. I'm experienced enough to let the abuse roll off. If blowing up at me makes her feel better, she's welcome to call me names any time. I admire her not just for competing in these events but also for all the training and disciplined training, eating, and sleeping she does on top of working an important job full-time, being a wife, a mom, and a grandmother. I don't call her Wonder Woman for nothing!</p>\n<p>When the race is over, we will have to pack the car and drive back to the hotel. We've arranged a late checkout so we can both get some sleep before driving home and going back to work on Monday.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

Over the next 15 years my cohort, smaller than the one that preceded it and the one that followed it (Millenials), began to reap the meager rewards our parents bequeathed us, single-parent families, careers as latch-key kids, run away inflation and coming of age with Reagan in the White House making it easy on rich folks and kicking off the decline of the middle class by breaking unions and kicking income inequality into high gear.</p>\n<p>The oldest Gen X-ers are only five years from retirement. Everything seems to have changed for us. We bought records we traded in for tapes that we traded in for CDs before we downloaded MP3s that we stopped listening to when we had to start paying a subscription fee to listen to music. After graduating from high school, I supported a wife and a baby by cooking at a Shoney's and serving in the National Guard one weekend a month. By the time my youngest reached maturity, two adults working full time at entry level jobs could barely make ends meet.</p>\n<p>We experienced a few cool things, like getting to watch MTV when they played music video. We've had some great music. We got to transition out of a world that worried about nuclear holocausts. Unfortunately we got to see AIDS put in an end to the free love we thought we were going to get.

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/p070wbmx-resized.webp\" alt=\"The Night Watch\" /></p>\n<p>Back in the days when people still bought encyclopedias, my parents were confronted by an especially good salesman who sold them not only a full set of the Book of Knowledge but also a collection of classic literature. When I was in elementary school, I tackled many of those books because I thought they sounded interesting. I mean, Gulliver's Travels was about little people, and Pilgrim's Progress was about (I thought) American pioneers. I plowed through the books with as much understanding as I could muster at that age, and can today truly state that I've read them. The problem is that it's been years since I felt any urge to approach that kind of book. When I see people reading The Scarlet Letter or Dante, I'm in awe. I would feel like I was back in high school senior English if I picked up one of those books. I'm even inherently suspicious when an enthusiastic reviewer claims that a novel in one of the genres I like these days‚ÄîEnglish detective novels, science fiction, military fiction‚Äîrises to the level of literature.</p>\n<p>I'm generally OK with my lack of formal education. I managed to learn enough on my own to support myself through retirement. I can talk to anybody and don't suffer from low self-esteem (quite the opposite if you ask Wonder Woman). I just regret not being exposed to classes like music appreciation and art appreciation. I enjoy some classical music. I've listened to Vivaldi enough that I can generally recognize his compositions, but I don't have any background in theory. Opera is a mystery, and I've only got a rudimentary knowledge of the development of jazz, although I do have a good collection of Miles Davis and John Coltrane.</p>\n<p>When it comes to art, well, I've been to one exhibition‚ÄîNorman Rockwell. I thoroughly enjoyed it, but I know that hardly qualifies me as a connoisseur. I can name famous artists and tell a Rothko from a Jackson Pollock, but I still feel under-qualified. My son takes trips to Boston and New York just to visit art museums. Considerable space in his tiny Austin bungalow is given over to his collection of art books, and the walls are covered in originals he's purchased at galleries. My walls are covered in pictures of my grandkids and Wonder Woman's photography, which is admittedly pretty arty.</p>\n<p>I rarely like any film that wins the Best Picture award from the Academy. In fact, I am still mad at myself for sitting through The English Patient all those years ago. It's not that I'm a fan of superhero movies‚Äînot that there is anything wrong with them‚ÄîI just seem to lack the gene that lets people discern symbolism in films. I'm very much an on-the-surface kind of guy. My most common reaction to reviews of arty movies is WTF?</p>\n<p>At this point in my life, I'm not likely to summon the energy to improve on any of this. I've learned to live with my shortcomings in appreciating things the way the more cultured folks do. I feel proud of myself for reading the occasional book of poetry (full disclosure: my son buys them for me) and for reading The New Yorker, Harper's, and The Atlantic. That will have to do, I suppose.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/leroy.webp\" alt=\"leroy\" /></p>\n<p>For one reason or another, I've taken some kind of medication on a daily basis for almost forty years. I am an expert at swallowing pills. I'd hate to estimate how many I've taken over the years. Despite the attempts by my insurance company to strong-arm me into using a mail-order pharmacy, I stubbornly cling to a locally owned one that I lucked into by being hard to get along with.</p>\n<p>I used to use various big box pharmacies. One thing I quickly learned by doing that was that the people there do not care about you. You might occasionally run into someone with a heart for people, but by and large, the pharmacists and techs there don't form relationships, and they stop seeing their customers as human beings after a while. That's been my experience. They will tell you to come back tomorrow in a minute. They will tell you that counting your own meds after they short you is your responsibility. Furthermore, they won't make the extra effort to deal with frustrating insurance companies. I pretty much would rather die a thousand deaths than deal with one.</p>\n<p>Luckily, a local pharmacist with good business sense saw an opportunity to draw business away from them by starting his own pharmacy in a good location. He hired nice, competent people, and most of the time, you could go in there with a prescription in hand and walk out within 15 minutes with your medicine. It was glorious. Unfortunately, he had two giant TVs right behind the cash register tuned in at all times to Fox News. I was in there when they were covering a story about poor people trapped in a flood after a hurricane. The owner of the pharmacy was ranting that it was all their own fault for not leaving. I disgustedly asked him if he thought maybe they should have just driven their Maserati out of town or something.</p>\n<p>I went home, went to the pharmacy's Facebook page, and left a scathing review, where I said they had good service but bad politics, and they weren't getting any more of my money as a result. I resigned myself to living in Big Box Hell. Some period after that, I got a message through Facebook from a name I didn't recognize. The writer, first name LeRoy, told me that he'd been a partner in the pharmacy but that he was leaving to go out on his own. He let me know that there would be no giant TVs playing Fox News in his new business and asked me to give him a chance, so I did.</p>\n<p>These days, when I go to a doctor's visit for med refills, LeRoy has them filled before I can get out of the parking lot. If I have a question or an issue about one of my prescriptions, I can message him via Facebook or text him to get an answer or a refill. He's fought every insurance battle that's faced me for a decade. When big pharma jacked up the price of one of my meds by 400%, LeRoy figured out how to get me a better price. If I'm late picking up a refill, he doesn't put my meds back on the shelf and yell at me on my next visit; he just holds on to them for me, secure in the knowledge that I will get there eventually.</p>\n<p>We are social media friends, and both of us are big baseball fans. I've followed his son's career from club ball through our local high school and summer ball. He now plays for the university where I work, which has one of the nation's best NCAA D3 baseball programs and a legendary coach. LeRoy's wife is a nurse practitioner with her own clinic, and she's treated me for everything from multi-day hiccups to a sliced finger.</p>\n<p>In a day and age where so many businesses seem as though they exist only to extract money from you, LeRoy and his pharmacy are a total exception. He gives unfailingly polite service and always makes me feel welcome and cared for. He inquires about my wife, asks about my job, and tells me about his last baseball trip.

I like chicken sandwiches OK, but I prefer the ones from Bojangles. Hell, I eat the ones they sell in gas stations. Every Chick-fil-A I come across is always super crowded. They have a reputation for dealing well with crowds, but you have to go be part of a crowd to find out if that's true. No thanks.</p>\n<p>The biggest reason I don't eat there though is their reputation for being homophobic. Someone in my area had a Chik-fil-A Support Day a couple of years ago and lots of ostentatious Christians that I know made a big deal out of going their and posting it on social media just in case they hadn't done enough in their lives to be shitty to  LGBT people.</p>\n<p>In doing some basic research for this post, I found that the hate-chicken people quit giving money to homophobic organizations a few years ago. The owner doesn't even use his personal fortune that way any more. Most people think the motivation behind that is to stave off boycotts and bad press and they are probably right. Right-wing organizations accused Chik-fil-A of caving the the Gay Agenda, if you can believe that.</p>\n<p>I know some principled leftists who patronize them now, partially because out of all the fast food chains, they offer more for people with celiacs.

You could use HTML to dress up what you wrote, so there was a small but satisfying thrill in learning how to be good at that. As usual, they had an off-topic category too, where you could write about whatever you wanted, and I contributed there all the time. People could follow you and send you private messages. I eventually outgrew it, but I tried to find a guy from there recently, after 27 years, and I succeeded because he's still using the same unique username.</p>\n<p>When I had a Geocities website, part of it was dedicated to Vietnam veterans and their kids. I corresponded with quite a few men and women who were eager to have someone to talk with about their experiences. I live near a giant army base, so all the vets I know have comrades-in-arms everywhere they go, but the 18-year-old who got drafted from Iowa in 1967 and did his year in hell didn't always have that, and I was glad to hear them out, publish their stories, and generally just be as supportive as I could.</p>\n<p>I was in some great bicycling forums around the turn of the century, one of which still sends me birthday greetings every year. I went as far as Georgia to meet folks from there for an organized ride.</p>\n<p>For a few years, believe it or not, I took part in the local newspaper's community forum, which was mostly a cesspool of name-calling and ad hominem attacks on liberals. I'd write outrageously provocative stuff about W. Bush and his wars just to stir up the flag wavers. They doxed me regularly, and the woman I was married to absolutely hated me going on there. After a while, it wasn't fun anymore, so I stopped.</p>\n<p>When I hiked the Appalachian Trail, I kept <a href='http://www.trailjournals.com/leftyandhush/'>an online journal</a> every single day and posted to a website called Trail Journals. As a result, I had people up and down the East Coast who wrote to us and visited us on the trail. It wasn't unusual to meet trail groupies who knew all kinds of our fellow hikers from reading their journals. More than a decade later, I am still in touch with people I first met through that journal.</p>\n<p>Then we enter the long dark winter of the soul‚ÄîFacebook was all there was. I never really used Twitter for anything other than news, so I didn't find much social about it. <a href='https://louplummer.lol/why-im-still-on-facebook/'>My Facebook experience is much the same as many folks</a>. In 2008, it was a place to keep up with friends and family and to reconnect with people from the past. Today, it's the same toxic hellscape for me as it is for everyone else. I mostly stay there to see pictures of my grandkids. In 2017, I had a viral post that caused me to get literally thousands of friend requests, many of which I accepted for the hell of it. I met plenty of cool people, including a friend I eventually met in Derry, Northern Ireland.</p>\n<p>My experience on the IndieWeb since I joined <a href='https://amerpie.lol'>micro.blog</a> in January has been my favorite experience out of all of them. In 10 months, I've posted more on <a href='https://social.lol/@amerpie'>Mastodon</a> than I did on Twitter in 15 years. I have three accounts on different servers. I closed my Twitter account too, not wanting to send any traffic to what is essentially the Nazi Bar of the Internet. I am a happy customer of <a href='https://linkage.lol/omglol-is-the-best-thing-on-the-internet/'>OMG.LOL</a>, <a href='https://patreon.com/500social'>500.social</a>, and <a href='https://onephoto.club'>Onephoto.club</a>. Aside from Micro.blog, I also use <a href='https://scribbles.page'>Scribbles</a> and <a href='https://bearblog.dev/'>BearBlog.</a></p>\n<p>I have accounts on Instagram, Threads, BlueSky, Pinterest, Nostr, Pixelfed, Farcaster, and Tumblr, but I use them mostly to syndicate what I write on my blogs.</p>\n<p>I do love Reddit, where I've <a href='https://www.reddit.com/user/amerpie/'>had an account for nearly 19 years</a>, despite its checkered past. Syndicating <a href='https://apps.louplummer.lol'>AppAddict</a> there has driven lots of traffic to my website. Earlier this year, I volunteered to become a moderator of <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/'>r/macOS</a>, a subreddit with over 300K members. That's been interesting. I get a chance to help out newbies and to stamp out some toxicity, so what it lacks in actual fun, it makes up in satisfaction.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

This can be\nproblematic during your work day if you need the full system resources\nof your computer, but it has decided to start copying a bunch of files\nto your backup. The venerable utility, Time Machine Editor, a free app\nby developer Thomas Clement is the solution to this problem. To use TME,\nyou first need to go into Time Machine options in System Settings and\nset your backups to &quot;Manually.&quot; Download and install TME from <a\nhref=\"https://tclementdev.com/timemachineeditor/\">the developers&#39;s\nwebsite</a> or through Homebrew.</p>\n\n<pre>brew install --cask timemachineeditor</pre>\n\n<p>Once installed, you can choose any of several options to schedule Time\nMachine backups. On my work iMac, I chose to stop the backups between\n8am and 5pm when I am using the computer but to continue hourly backups\nafter that. To be on the safe side, TME allows you to create local disk\nsnapshots during the time you are not writing to your backup disk. They\nare very fast to make, and provide additional restoration points. Since\nthey are local, they do not protect against a disk crash but can be\nuseful if the machine goes away from the backup disk for a while.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve used this utility for more than a decade, and it&#39;s never let me\ndown.</p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Good Old Time Machine Editor - A Useful Free Utility' style='text-decoration: underline'>‚úâÔ∏è Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

Although I am partial to the mountains, there is something to be said for visiting the colonial historical sites closer to the coast. Whether it's Jamestown, one of the first settlements in the new world, Yorktown, site of the American victory in the Revolutionary War or the extensive and richly restored town of Colonial Williamsburg, you won't be disappointed. Thankfully, the exhibits in Williamsburg include ones dedicated to Native American and African American history. It's quite an experience to walk the streets and see people in colonial dress, gardening with period tools and making the same type of crafts that were common in the 1700s. It's a fun and affordable way to spend  a day.  If you are a cyclist, bring your bike. The 23-mile Colonial Parkway between Yorktown and Jamestown is a road you'll want to add to the miles you've traveled while pedaling.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.colonialwilliamsburg.org/learn/about-colonial-williamsburg/history/'>History of Colonial Williamsburg</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://www.nps.gov/colo/parkway.htm'>Colonial Parkway - Colonial National Historical Park (U.S. National Park Service)</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://historicjamestowne.org/visit/plan-your-visit/'>Plan Your Visit | Historic Jamestowne</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://www.nps.gov/york/planyourvisit/index.htm'>Plan Your Visit - Yorktown Battlefield Part of Colonial National Historical Park (U.S. National Park Service)</a>\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/bbdb8f67-6ccc-4fd1-9155-b1969c01577a_1_105_c.webp\" alt=\"Maine Lobster\" /></p>\n<p>The year Wonder Woman and I hiked the Appalachian Trail, we were away from home for 156 days, from early May to mid-October. At the beginning of our journey, I weighed around 230 pounds. By the end, I had dropped to 180 pounds and was wearing medium-sized clothes for the first time since high school. For most long-distance hikers, the two overriding feelings are ravenous hunger and fatigue. The trail involves over 400,000 feet of climbing, stretching from Maine to Georgia and covering just shy of 2,200 miles. It‚Äôs almost impossible for hikers to carry enough food to sustain their weight, though some manage better than others for physiological reasons I can‚Äôt quite grasp.</p>\n<p>In preparation for our hike, we spent a lot of time packing boxes of food for my daughter and son-in-law to mail to us at various hostels, outfitters, and general delivery post offices along the way. We bought cases of oatmeal, Pop-Tarts, energy bars, corn chips, and other pre-made food. We also dehydrated large quantities of sweet potatoes, black beans, and several London broils to make beef jerky. Since Wonder Woman has celiac disease and can‚Äôt eat wheat, we were concerned about finding adequate food for her along the trail. In hindsight, we shouldn‚Äôt have worried‚Äîor prepared so much food. We ended up giving away large portions of it when it became monotonous. To our surprise, finding gluten-free food wasn‚Äôt as challenging as we had anticipated.</p>\n<p>A guy my size, carrying a 25-pound backpack and climbing mountains all day in hot weather, can burn upwards of 5,000 calories a day if he hikes long enough. We typically woke up around 5:00 AM to eat and pack our gear. My breakfast usually consisted of two large honeybuns thickly covered with peanut butter or Nutella. Occasionally, I‚Äôd indulge in a bagel. I drank instant coffee boiled over the beer can alcohol stove I packed. While hiking, I‚Äôd consume a Snickers bar or a couple of Nature Valley granola bars every hour. I also ate quite a few Clif bars, but I found they tasted progressively worse the more I had.</p>\n<p>For lunch and dinner, I often wrapped my meals in a big flour tortilla. My fillings included tuna, cheese from a block I carried, dried beef or Slim Jims, hot sauce, and maybe some crumbled Fritos. I always had a second tortilla with peanut butter. For dessert, I enjoyed candy, usually Whoppers or dark chocolate. I also devoured countless bags of pork rinds‚Äîthey weigh almost nothing and pack a whopping 900 calories per bag. Sometimes I‚Äôd eat a couple of family packs of instant mashed potatoes or instant rice or pasta dishes from Lipton. I‚Äôm proud to say that, unlike most of my fellow hikers, I didn‚Äôt eat any ramen noodles. I like them just fine, but they simply didn‚Äôt appeal to me at the time. After returning home, I discovered that I had royally messed up my electrolyte balance by not getting enough sodium, so maybe some ramen would have been a good idea after all.</p>\n<p>Hiker hunger is truly on display at restaurants in the towns along the trail. Every few days, hikers need to find a place to buy supplies, wash their clothes, and grab a shower. However, they don‚Äôt do any of that until they‚Äôve filled their bellies at whatever establishment they can find. There were times when I‚Äôd order a meal, quickly finish it, and then order a second meal before feeling even slightly full.\nAlongside the food, I‚Äôd drink entire pitchers of Coke, or, when we were in the South, sweet iced tea. We were always on the lookout for any AYCE (all you can eat) places, although I was asked to leave a Chinese buffet in Pittsfield, MA, after my sixth plate. In New Jersey, there‚Äôs a stretch of trail that allows you to hit quite a few delis in a short span, and I certainly took advantage of that. In New England, I savored a delicacy we don‚Äôt have in North Carolina: gigantic full-belly clams. Of course, in Maine, I enjoyed fresh lobster during a memorable meal in Millinocket, the town near the northern terminus of Mount Katahdin.</p>\n<p>Most of the weight I lost came back within a year. To this day, I haven‚Äôt had another Snickers bar, and I went a decade without eating a honeybun. I‚Äôm not a Nutella fan anymore, although I still enjoy a fair amount of peanut butter. Whenever we travel to trail towns during hiking season, I always nudge Wonder Woman if I see a hiker come in, so we can watch them order the prodigious amount of food they typically get. It brings back such fond memories.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

On the first day, we set a record for voter turnout. Even in the western portions of the state where a recent hurricane destroyed roads and where many people still don't have power, the number of people who turned out exceeded the numbers from four years ago when conditions were not impeded. Wonder Woman and I always try to vote early, partly to get it out of the way and partly out of excitement.</p>\n<p>This year we went to a recreation center located about three miles from our house. My kids went to dances there when they were in school, and I have taken my grandchildren there many times to play on the playground. Today I went to defend democracy from the fascists trying to take over my country. Donald Trump recently called people like me \"radical left lunatics\" and said we are \"the enemy within.\"</p>\n<p>We were met by campaign volunteers from various candidates, who are allowed to approach voters as long as they stay 50 feet or more from the front doors. I gratefully accepted a voter guide from a guy who had a list of all the Democratic candidates and offered polite \"no, thank yous\" to everyone else who wanted to hand me literature. I usually try to research all the obscure races ahead of time, but I was glad to have the guide nonetheless. We used to be able to do straight party voting here, but the Republicans eliminated it because they thought it would help them.</p>\n<p>Most of the people in line were younger and there were lots of POC. One dumb ass showed up in full Trump rally regalia and people were staring daggers at him. I wanted to catch his eye and mouth \"I'm canceling your vote\" but he kept staring at the floor, too embarrassed, I hope to feel like he could hold his head up amongst his perceived enemies. In my mind, whenever I am in line to vote, the happy people are always Democrats and the sour pusses are Republicans. Unfortunately, 60% of white men are probably going to vote for Trump, citing many different reasons but the primary one, I am convinced is to perpetuate white supremacy. Yeah, screw that. Not this white guy.</p>\n<p>We had one extremely stupid constitutional amendment to vote on, one that would make excluding everyone under the age of 18 who isn't a US citizen from voting. If you thought there was already a law in place that did that, you would be right, but you underestimate the idiocy of the Republican Party who wants to plant the idea in their pitiful voter's heads that the Democrats are getting ready to allow children and illegal immigrants to cancel Bubba's vote. These people are pitiful.</p>\n<p>I will be glad when the election is settled. I expect there to be all kinds of controversy and dirty tricks from the other side. Another insurrection is certainly a possibility. They are losers but they don't lose gracefully.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

It launches a web interface that walks you through setting\nup you first backup. To test it, I elected to create a backup of my\nObsidian vault using my free Dropbox account as the file storage\ndestination. I elected to back the files up every 24 hours and it has\nbeen running every day at exactly the time I selected.¬†</p>\n\n<p>Duplicati also works with Google Drive, One Drive and Box as well as\nAzure Blob and Amazon S3.

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/stereotype1.webp\" alt=\"stereotype1\" /></p>\n<p>I'm not going to pretend that I don't make assumptions about people from time to time because, as much as I try not to, I fall into the trap occasionally. I'm glad that, for the most part, plenty of other people and I seem to be less inclined to do it these days. We are learning not to assume that when someone is married, it's necessarily to someone of the opposite sex. We aren't as surprised when we find out that our friend's new love interest is from a different race. I love meeting someone who is into technology as much as I am who doesn't play video games, so I don't feel like such an outsider.</p>\n<p>At the university where I work, the Dean of the College of Arts, Humanities & Sciences, who is a Professor of Religion & Philosophy, is covered in tattoos. The university chief of staff, a diminutive ex-banker, swears like a sailor. The football coach, who looks for all the world like a defensive tackle, turns out to have been a record-setting quarterback in college. The best network engineer I ever worked with talks with an accent that would fit right in \"The Dukes of Hazzard\" or \"Hee-Haw.\"</p>\n<p>People from other regions of the country (or the world) can easily have stereotypes of those of us from the South here in the US. That stereotype is that we are conservative, a little (or a lot) racist, old-fashioned, and uneducated. I always feel that I need to establish my progressive bona fides quickly, especially if someone knows I'm also a veteran or that I worked in manufacturing. I have to do that for my fellow Southerners too, just to keep the ones who actually are conservative racists from trying to include me in their conversations. I am not the type to ever hide a single facet of my personality or beliefs from anyone. I want people to know exactly who and what they are dealing with.</p>\n<p>It seems to be a driving force within conservatism to work towards putting people back into stereotypical roles. Organizations that have used DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) are routinely attacked by Republicans, who paint the whole idea as a disturbance to the natural order of the world. They want women and people of color to stay in their traditional places. They make no secret of their disdain for same-sex marriage. When they try to practice inclusion, they use unqualified bootlickers like Herschel Walker or Mark Robinson or someone with the flawed party loyalty of Nikki Haley.</p>\n<p>Learning how to escape thinking in stereotypes can be a lifelong process. Some people seem to naturally escape those kinds of attitudes, while others, like me, have had to be deprogrammed throughout our lives. I'm sure I have a long way to go, but I'm happy with how far I have come. Being open-minded is the goal.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

In the intervening 10 months that I have been back creating things on the IndyWeb on Micro.blog, Scribbles, OMG.LOL and BearBlog, I have learned a lot about how to make my web pages do what I want and how to include certain elements. The learning process is ongoing, and I am always on the lookout for use tools.

The pharmacy used to put my medicine back on the shelf until they learned my patterns. I told Wonder Woman that I was going to buy a new pair of shoes for about a year before I actually ordered them. It's not that I am lazy; I do plenty. It's just that I need A LOT of time to think about doing things before actually doing them. I don't know why the prospect of seeing something that needs to be done and then actually doing it is repugnant to me, but it is.</p>\n<p>I have collected quotes for years. I have a number of applications to keep them, plus a plain text <a href='https://github.com/cyclelou/Amerpie'>repository that I maintain on GitHub.</a> I'm super diligent about identifying quotes I want to save, copying them to a specific workspace in an app I use, and making sure I've got all the pertinent metadata: author, source, etc. And that's where the process gets bogged down. I may wait until I have 40 or 50 quotes saved up before I sit down and make myself catalog and tag them and file them in the various places where I like to keep them for reference. For a while, I tried to make doing that a part of my nightly checklist, but that habit did not stick.</p>\n<p>There are other computer-related chores that I put off. I have all the emails from Netflix, Hulu, Max, etc. filtered into a specific mailbox so that I can go through them all at one time and add shows and movies that look promising to our playlists. I have an app, <a href='https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/sequel-entertainment-database'>Sequel</a>, that consolidates the playlists, so I don't even have to go to multiple websites to add them. I even have a recurring task set up in my to-do app to remind me to do this every Sunday, typically the slowest day of the week. Yeah, I am about three months behind.</p>\n<p>We have a spare bedroom where I usually take naps on off days. The cheap bed frame I ordered from Amazon literally came apart, as in it separated into pieces. I was still napping away on the mattress and putting up with the crazy tilt and weird lumps. Wonder Woman found out about it, and BOOM, instantly fixed. She is a procrastination enabler.</p>\n<p>Some things can't be put off, obviously. One of my jobs is preparing dinner for us. She is perpetually hungry because her ultramarathon training burns a lot of calories, and she needs to keep her energy levels up. I learned a long time ago that delaying meal times was a non-starter in our house. All I need is a hangry super heroine coming at me looking for a meal!</p>\n<p>I'm also pretty disciplined about my blogging. I am currently riding a 204-day streak of posting every day. If I know I'm going to have a busy night, I try to knock something out in the morning before work or at lunch, although sometimes I just have to stay up late. When it comes to habits, I am always better off if I do them 100% regularly. The last time I meditated with discipline, I managed a 365-day streak, and my Apple Watch rings record is a consecutive 617 days without missing one. All this is balanced by streaks I have for putting things off, like replacing my deck, which I have now successfully stalled for two-plus years.</p>\n<p>I don't think this makes me a terrible person. At least, I hope it doesn't. One day I might have to do something about it. .<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

				"title": "My Letter to a Homophobic Friend",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/gsa-less-than250.webp\" alt=\"gsa-less-than250\" /></p>\n<p>I'm a digital pack rat who enjoys browsing through decades-old emails and blog posts from the 90s when I was on GeoCities. I recently found a letter I wrote to a homophobic friend in 1997, where I tried to disabuse him of some backward notions and challenge some of his beliefs. I won't reprint the whole thing because parts of it are cringeworthy, and I use language in it that wouldn't fly today. However, I am glad to see that most of what I believed 27 years ago, I still believe today.</p>\n<p>My friend was unhappy that the use of the word \"homophobia\" was becoming common. He said no one was afraid of gay people and that there was no fear involved. My response dipped into armchair psychology mode, but in hindsight, I still see it as a valid argument.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is a fear of homosexuals in our society. I believe almost everyone has, at some point, either had some sort of homosexual experience (rarely) or had a homosexual fantasy (commonly). This act or thought provokes such shame and guilt in some people, usually men, that a strong aversion occurs‚Äîone that is so psychologically entwined with self-identity that an overemphasis occurs in denying or rejecting the act or thought. We all know men who are so insecure they can't carry their wife's purse for her, buy her tampons, or admit that Tom Cruise is handsome. Why? Because someone might think they are gay, and since they once had a homosexual fantasy, they might be gay. So they better tell some [gay] jokes, buy themselves a four-wheel-drive pickup, a shotgun, and a Pit Bull, and put that rumor to rest right now.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>His other complaint was that the \"homosexual agenda\" was being pushed and promoted. I think the people doing the promotion were \"the liberals\" and \"the media.\" This was during the Clinton administration, when the culture wars were just getting started, but the flames of it were already burning brightly.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Since I live in North Carolina, prime Bible Belt country, I don't get to see this homosexual promotion everyone is talking about. In fact, I see the opposite. People may not use the N-word much anymore, but calling someone the other F-word happens all the time. Some of the gay people I know are ridiculed, shunned, and ostracized. I've never known a gay recruiter sent by the National Gay Headquarters to a lonely post in my town to convert school children to the cause. I do know my company doesn't fire openly gay employees as it did ten years ago, but I also know people who don't feel sorry for AIDS victims. Logic tells me that no one chooses to be gay any more than you choose to be straight. Who would pick a lifestyle that offers the possibility of harassment, discrimination, the loss of family ties, and the small chance of ever being a parent?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thankfully, some of my arguments seem simplistic today. Maybe they are even regarded as common sense. As a straight guy with the privilege that entails, I have the luxury of only thinking about the subject when I feel like it or when I see some backward behavior. Unfortunately, the right wing has chosen to ramp up its attacks with things like banning books about LGBT issues and making Tim Walz's sponsorship of the Gay/Straight Alliance at the high school where he taught into an issue.</p>\n<p>Since I wrote that letter, some positive things have happened in American society. Same-sex marriage was legalized, and lots of people now know same-sex couples. Contrary to the fearmongering by conservatives, none of us straight folks had to get divorced, nor is it now legal to marry your pet. You can also be gay and out in the military without jeopardizing your career. Last time I checked, the US wasn't threatened by another country due to the weak state of the Army and Marines. I'm glad both of those things have happened, and I hope that an inevitable future conservative win in an election doesn't undermine them.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

Football coaches and motivational speakers may beg to differ, but they have a vested interest in making people think that they can always just try harder to achieve success by whatever definition is popular that day. I don't buy it. I believe that people want to succeed. They want to be good parents, good employees, good spouses. Hell, they just want to be good. In the real world though we are faced with all kinds of mundane challenges, from differing energy levels, differing states of mental clarity and motivational levels that rise and fall on a sea of different inputs.</p>\n<p>I'm not advocating using this sentiment as a cop out for slacking. I'm advocating it as an explanation for the human condition. There are healthy methods of self-criticism, and then there are unhealthy feelings of low self-worth or guilt that serves no purpose. A certain amount of staring at one's own belly button is OK, but excessive bouts of obsessing over previous life choices is a self-centered exercise that serves little purpose. Learning how to be easy on yourself is the first step in extending that same level of acceptance to those you feel have let you down in life, whether it be your parents, former bosses or the bully in third grade.</p>\n<p>I started my parenting journey as an 18-year-old living in a trailer park making $4.25 an hour, riding a Sears bicycle to work. By the time my oldest left to join the Navy, I owned a home, a couple of cars and had a state job from which I retired. Today that kid (now 41) manages a team of 600 people, talks to me all the time and has a life that would make plenty of people envious. He turned out just fine. I made plenty of mistakes with my kids. I don't say that lightly at all. Of course, I wish I'd been better in the Dad game, but I know longer wallow in any kind of guilt. My love for them never wavered, and that is what's important.</p>\n<p>As a four times married recovering alcoholic with bipolar disorder, you better believed that I have regrets. I just don't have self-loathing. Life can be incredibly hard for the best equipped among us. Throw in a few handicaps and we all become miracles very quickly.</p>\n<p>Everyone has a story. Everyone has things in their life other people don't know about. You can't tell who is recovering from a family death, who suffers from chronic pain, or who is desperately searching for an antidepressant that actually works. Some people make a big deal about not being judgmental, but I don't buy it. Being judgmental is a survival skill. I make judgments all the time, but I try not to do it in a way that lets other people live rent-free in my head. In my line of work, I deal with people who don't like or understand technology. Some get frustrated easily and act out when their computer doesn't do what they want it to. I don't like being treated rudely, who does, but I understand where they are coming from. I just file them in the appropriate mental category and I move on, or at least I try.</p>\n<p>I don't pretend to love every one. I can't use \"they're doing the best they can\" to solve all my issues with the world. It doesn't help me understand or forgive Trump supporters, uncaring bosses or various flavors of mean people, but it definitely helps me deal with the people I care about.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/oil.webp\" alt=\"Oil Well\" /></p>\n<p>Somehow, when I first investigated starting a blog, I managed to avoid the many websites devoted to creating a money-making machine <strong>USING THESE 10 SIMPLE TRICKS!!!</strong> The blogs I was familiar with weren't covered in ads, and I didn't have to pay to read them. There was an occasional invitation to buy the writer a coffee, but nothing high-pressure or gross.</p>\n<p>A couple of weeks ago, Keenan, the creator of A Very Good Blog, <a href='https://gkeenan.co/avgb/ive-missed-sam-for-a-very-long-time-or-pick-your-battles/'>wrote a long, heartfelt post</a> about his lifelong relationship with his much-loved cousin and how the American political divide affected their relationship. It's the kind of work that deserves to be included in an anthology and everyone's Best of 2024 collections. It wasn't surrounded by banner advertisements or cut off in the middle with a place for paying customers to log in. No, it was offered to the world as the work of art it most certainly is. Many people have now read it, shared it, cried over it, and been inspired by it. The ability to write like that is a gift Keenan shares with the world. The people who recognize the richness of the Indy Web, the small web, and the blogs that comprise it are the grateful beneficiaries of Keenan's largesse. They, I mean, we, are a community who share pieces of ourselves, of our lives with one another because we feel called to do it.</p>\n<p>I like to write, and of course, I want what I publish to be seen by as many people who might care to read it, but I don't want to approach what I have to share with a marketer's eye. My blogging style is mostly autobiographical and very personal. I write about my life, warts and all. I feel good when I finish a post. I'd never want to worry that I needed to appeal to this or that demographic or use certain keywords to make Google like me. I just want to tell stories, make people think, and be a part of the small group that rejects corporate algorithms in favor of honest engagement with an audience that isn't manipulated into viewing <a href='https://louplummer.lol/'>Living Out Loud</a>, <a href='https://louplummer.lol/'>Linkage</a>, or <a href='https://apps.louplummer.lol/'>AppAddict</a>.</p>\n<p>Since 1994 I've made a living by helping people with technology problems in one way or another. Luckily, my interest in computers hasn't been ruined by doing it for a living. But that's just it. I already have a profession I love. I have no more desire to pad my bank account by blogging than I do in finding a way to monetize my bicycle or my hiking boots. It's shameful that there's a movement in this country to have people monetize their hobbies when what we need is a movement to make sure working people earn enough from their jobs so that they can have meaningful lives away from work.</p>\n<p>I make no claims at artistry. I'm just a guy with a laptop and some spare time. I'm grateful to anyone who uses part of their precious minutes on this earth to read what I post. I'm not planning on stopping, and I don't think I'll ever be interested in taking money out of your pocket.\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/paranoia-mike-king.webp\" alt=\"paranoia-mike-king\" /></p>\n<p>Being appropriately cautious is a survival skill. We have evolved to do things like sniff food before we eat it to make sure it isn't spoiled and to keep our guard up around strangers. A lot of human behavior is understandable in that context. I wouldn't consider myself reckless in any way. I drive cautiously enough. I haven't been in any kind of physical confrontation in decades.</p>\n<p>Certain cautious behavior is gender based and makes perfect sense. Like most men, I don't think about being the victim of sexual assault. Most people have individualized reasons for their comfort with risk. I get it.</p>\n<p>Having said all that, I'm still not cool with paranoia. There is a certain amount of risk inherent in being a functional adult and no one gets to escape from all of it. When I see a person who is so risk averse that they deprive themselves, or worse, they deprive others, it drives me nuts. I like computers and software. It's kind of my thing. I see many, many people who act terrified to install or use all kinds of software out of unfounded or unspecified fears. I'm not just talking about technologically ignorant people either. There are people in my industry who think that there is something or someone nefarious behind every new app. There are ways to investigate these issues and ways to mitigate risk. Quit being paranoid!</p>\n<p>In jobs I have had, I trust that my bosses have enough faith in me to make professional decisions when a new situation arises. It's a judgment call, of course. There are times when one needs to seek guidance. Most of the time, however, I have no problem making a call and moving forward to get a job done. If my decisions are questioned, I feel fairly confident that I can defend them. I am sure you have encountered people though who get paralyzed if they are faced with the unknown. They come to a dead stop and act as if they just know they will \"get in trouble\" if they do anything without running it by the boss first. I want to grab these people by the neck and shake them. Quit being paranoid you sorry excuse for an adult. Quit trying to evade all responsibility. Grow a pair.</p>\n<p>Then there are the people who are sure that the mysterious \"they\" are out there thwarting progress and holding back the common man. The people who blame \"them\" without ever trying to get to the bottom of who \"they\" might be are another category I'm pretty derisive about. There is no doubt that giant corporations do not have society's best interest at heart. Capitalism is not structured that way. Rather than railing against the unknown, however, learn to name and shame the people and organizations behind your oppression. Let that knowledge influence how you vote and where you spend your money. We have limited power as individuals, but we do have some, plus we have the power to organize and to take collective action. That's how slavery was ended, how women got the vote, how child labor was outlawed and how every labor protection in existence came into being. Quit being paranoid. Do something!</p>\n<p>If anything about this offends you, I do not apologize. Quit being paranoid!<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

I&#39;ve been a\nKeyboard Maestro user for many years. I have over 800 macros within that\napplication and a lot of experience using it, but after working with\nKeysmith for just a short while, I have to admit it makes some actions\neasier to record and activate. It&#39;s not a replacement for Keyboard\nMaestro, but it will certainly supplement it.</p>\n\n<p>Keysmith detects buttons, lists, and page loads automatically. The first\nmacro I created with it was able to Open Obsidian, copy my daily note,\nopen Day One, create a new entry and paste the content from Obsidian. I\nassigned it to HyperKey+D and was able to trigger it while I was in my\nweb browser. I tinkered with it a little and was easily able to get it\nto close Day One after the entry was created.</p>\n\n<p>The process is simple. You start the recording of a macro from a button\non the menu bar. Your perform the action you need and Keysmith records\nyour clicks and keystrokes. When you&#39;re done, you save the macro, give\nit a name and assign a hotkey if you want to.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the example macros available for download on the Keysmith web\nsite are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Refresh extensions in Chrome</li>\n<li>Share screen in Discord</li>\n<li>Eject external hard drive in Finder</li>\n<li>Assign and submit a pull request on GitHub</li>\n<li>Enable Dark Mode in macOS</li>\n<li>New note with template in Apple Notes</li>\n<li>Switch to a specific Slack channel</li>\n<li>Switch to Zoom gallery view</li>\n<li>Quit all apps with AppleScript</li>\n<li>Close Notification Center in macOS</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You can use <a href=\"https://www.keysmith.app/purchase\">the total\nfunctionality of Keysmith for free</a> to make up to five macros. The\nfull version is $54. It is also available as part of <a\nhref=\"https://go.setapp.com/invite/kmjmclw4\">Setapp</a>.</p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Keysmith - Record Automation Macros With Ease' style='text-decoration: underline'>‚úâÔ∏è Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

This week I\nfound out that an ancient app (well, 17 years), <a\nhref=\"https://amarsagoo.info/licensed/\">Licensed</a>, has been updated\nand is compatible with macOS 15. Licensed is a simple database to keep\ntrack of your software purchases. It has fields for:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Maker</li>\n<li>Product</li>\n<li>Version</li>\n<li>Owner</li>\n<li>Email</li>\n<li>Code</li>\n<li>Date</li>\n<li>Notes</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The database is searchable. From the app&#39;s file menu, you can identify\nthe data file for easy backups, and you can export your data as a CSV\nfile so that you can be assured you aren&#39;t locked into any proprietary\nformat.</p>\n\n<p>Licensed is a free app from developer <a\nhref=\"https://amarsagoo.info/\">Amar Sagoo</a>. You can <a\nhref=\"https://amarsagoo.info/licensed/\">download it on his website.</a></p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Licensed - A Nice Single Purpose App for Keeping Track of Your Software' style='text-decoration: underline'>‚úâÔ∏è Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

As an Obsidian sync subscriber, not only am I contributing to a company I value, I also get to control all kinds of things I couldn&rsquo;t do before. Restoring deleted files either singularly or in bulk is supported. I also get tech support for syncing issues.</p>\n<h3 id=\"selective-sync\">Selective Sync</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2024/990df6e29f.jpeg\" alt=\"Selective Sync in Obsidian\"></p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t want to sync a number of larger folders on my phone to help Obsidian load faster, so I can exclude those from search. I don&rsquo;t need my receipt collection or software serial numbers or receipts on my mobile device and now I don&rsquo;t have to worry about it. This solves the problem many people have about how many vaults to have.

				"content_text": "![Basic vault configuration in Obsidian](https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2024/d7af05de68.jpeg)\r\n\r\nWhen i used iCloud to sync Obsidian, I saved a whopping $4 a month and got next to no granular control over the process. As an Obsidian sync subscriber, not only am I contributing to a company I value, I also get to control all kinds of things I couldn't do before. Restoring deleted files either singularly or in bulk is supported. I also get tech support for syncing issues.\r\n\r\n### Selective Sync\r\n\r\n![Selective Sync in Obsidian](https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2024/990df6e29f.jpeg)\r\n\r\nI don't want to sync a number of larger folders on my phone to help Obsidian load faster, so I can exclude those from search. I don't need my receipt collection or software serial numbers or receipts on my mobile device and now I don't have to worry about it. This solves the problem many people have about how many vaults to have. If you don't want your personal notes on your work computer, it's very easy to exclude them from syncing without having to create a separate vault.\r\n\r\n**Choose to sync:**<br>\r\n- Folders <br>\r\n- Images <br>\r\n- Audio <br>\r\n- Video <br>\r\n- PDFs <br>\r\n- All other file types <br>\r\n\r\nI don't have much audio and video in my vault, but what i do have, I elect not to sync on mobile for speed reasons.\r\n\r\n###  Vault Configuration Sync\r\n\r\n![Vault Configuration Synci in Obsidiain](https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2024/c620b4ccf4.jpeg)\r\n\r\nIf I find that I've made some untraceable changes to my settings, I can take advantage of automatic backup of my settings file to restore them to a known good state.\r\n\r\n**Sync items:** <br>\r\n- Main settings <br>\r\n- Appearance Settings <br>\r\n- Themes and CSS <br>\r\n- Hotkeys <br>\r\n- Active core plugins <br>\r\n- Active community plugins <br>\r\n- Installed community plugins <br>\r\n\r\nI elect to sync my settings, hotkeys, appearance and theme between devices, but I can toggle each one of these if I choose.\r\n\r\nI can turn plugins on and off depending on what computer I'm using.

That&rsquo;s a wise attitude to take for plugins that affect data, but what about plugins that just make Obsidian easier to use? What&rsquo;s the reason for not trying those? These 10 plugins don&rsquo;t leave any code fragments in your notes. They just make Obsidian better.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1-commanderhttpsgithubcomphibr0obsidian-commander\">1. <a href=\"https://github.com/phibr0/obsidian-commander\">Commander</a></h2>\n<p>Commander lets you add and remove commands from the Obsidian interface.

Mononote does one thing, it keeps you from having multiple copies of the same note open at once. If you ever looked at your tab bar and seen multiple copies of your daily note staring at you, install this plugin to prevent that from ever happening again.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5-note-refactorhttpsgithubcomlynchjamesnote-refactor-obsidian\">5. <a href=\"https://github.com/lynchjames/note-refactor-obsidian\">Note Refactor</a></h2>\n<p>Note Refactor helps you split and extract content from your current notes. If you&rsquo;ve clipped a long web article and you want to break it down into smaller more easily digestible atomic notes, Note Refactor is the tool you want.

Plugin Update Tracker lets me know at a glance if I have any updates and to what plugins. It will let me read the release notes and even wait a specified number days before notifying me when updates become available so that the early adopters can get the kinks worked out. If there are plugins you wish to ignore updates from, you can do that too.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7-read-it-laterhttpsgithubcomdominikpieperobsidian-readitlater\">7. <a href=\"https://github.com/DominikPieper/obsidian-ReadItLater\">Read It Later</a></h2>\n<p>ReadItLater collects information from your clipboard and creates notes based on the type of content you have saved there. Videos from YouTube, Billibilli, TikTok and Vimeo will be displayed in an inline iFrame based on the clipboard URL. Mastodon toots and URLs will be imported as complete notes generated from nothing more than a URL on your clipboard. It&rsquo;s one of the easiest ways to get web content in your blog.

Have Obsidian Open to the Same Page Every Time You Start the App</h2>\n<p>By default, Obsidian opens up to the state you left it in when you closed it. With the <a href=\"https://github.com/mirnovov/obsidian-homepage\">Homepage community plugin</a> - you can use any note, canvas, or workspace as a homepage.

Assign a Basic Set of File Properties to Every Note You Create</h2>\n<p>You can do this using the Linter plugin. The setting is on the YAML tab of the options for Linter.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2024/cleanshot-2024-06-01-at-19.20.292x.jpeg\" alt=\"Setting for file properties in the Linter plugin for Obsidian\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"3-edit-the-file-properties-of-multiple-notes-at-one-time\">3. Edit the File Properties of Multiple Notes at One time</h2>\n<p>If you have multiple notes where you&rsquo;d like to add or remove file properties in one fell swoop without having to edit them each individually, the use the <a href=\"https://github.com/fez-github/obsidian-multi-properties\">Multi-Properties plugin</a>. It works for tags or any other file property you want.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4-send-an-email-to-your-obsidian-vault-for-mac-users\">4. Send an Email to Your Obsidian Vault (for Mac users)</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2024/cleanshot-2024-06-01-at-19.32.482x.jpeg\" alt=\"An IFTTT applet to create text files in Dropbox based on emails\"></p>\n<p>Set up an IFTTT applet to create a text file in a cloud service like based on an email you send to a certain address. Then use the app, <a href=\"https://www.noodlesoft.com/\">Hazel</a>, to have the file renamed with a .md extension and moved to your vault. <a href=\"https://amerpie.lol/2024/02/04/how-to-send.html\">More information on setting this up</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"5-quickly-capture-data-to-your-obsidian-vault-on-ios\">5. Quickly Capture Data to Your Obsidian Vault on iOS</h2>\n<p>The key to this at this point is using the right third-party app. I personally use <a href=\"https://getdrafts.com/\">Drafts</a> most of the time, but have recently been experimenting with a new app, <a href=\"https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/bebop-quick-notes\">Bebop</a> and with <a href=\"https://www.fleetingnotes.app/\">Fleeting Notes</a>. The Obsidian roadmap states that they are hard at work improving the native abilities of Obsidian on mobile. <a href=\"https://amerpie.lol/2024/02/22/obsidian-great-but.html\">More software to complement Obsidian.</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"6-search-and-replace-text-across-your-entire-vault-at-once\">6. Search And Replace Text Across Your Entire Vault at Once</h2>\n<p>To do this, you can use the free features of different power-users text editors ¬†I use¬†<a href=\"https://notepad-plus-plus.org/\">Notepad++</a>¬†(PC) and¬†<a href=\"https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/\">BBedit</a>¬†(Mac) for multi-file search and replace. They‚Äôre both fast, handle case-matching, and the basic features are free. <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\">Vscode</a> is another favorite and it is cross-platform.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2024/cleanshot-2024-06-01-at-19.51.462x.jpeg\" alt=\"Search and replace in BBEdit\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"7-automatically-sync-a-backup-copy-of-your-vault-to-a-cloud-service-every-night-while-you-sleep\">7. Automatically Sync a Backup Copy of Your Vault to a Cloud Service Every Night While You Sleep</h2>\n<p>You need a couple of utilities to make this happen. The first is a file-syncing utility that runs automatic syncs. I use <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sync-folders/id530573877\">Sync Folders Pro</a>, a $9 app from the app store. Then you need an app that automatically launched your sync program. On the Mac you can use <a href=\"https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/lingon-x-finds-all-the-junk\">Lingon X,</a> <a href=\"https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/\">Keyboard Maestro</a> or <a href=\"https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/alarm-clock-pro\">Alarm Clock Pro</a>. <a href=\"https://amerpie.lol/2024/02/11/automating-your-obsidian.html\">More backup information</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8-import-entire-web-pages-with-nothing-more-than-a-url-on-the-clipboard\">8.

You just copy an address from a web page you want to save, switch to Obsidian and activate it ReadItLater from the command pallet.

It works for tags or any other file property you want.\r\n\r\n## 4. Send an Email to Your Obsidian Vault (for Mac users)\r\n\r\n![An IFTTT applet to create text files in Dropbox based on emails](https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2024/cleanshot-2024-06-01-at-19.32.482x.jpeg)\r\n\r\nSet up an IFTTT applet to create a text file in a cloud service like based on an email you send to a certain address. Then use the app, [Hazel](https://www.noodlesoft.com/), to have the file renamed with a .md extension and moved to your vault. [More information on setting this up](https://amerpie.lol/2024/02/04/how-to-send.html)\r\n\r\n## 5. Quickly Capture Data to Your Obsidian Vault on iOS\r\n\r\nThe key to this at this point is using the right third-party app. I personally use [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/) most of the time, but have recently been experimenting with a new app, [Bebop](https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/bebop-quick-notes) and with [Fleeting Notes](https://www.fleetingnotes.app/). The Obsidian roadmap states that they are hard at work improving the native abilities of Obsidian on mobile. [More software to complement Obsidian.](https://amerpie.lol/2024/02/22/obsidian-great-but.html)\r\n\r\n## 6. Search And Replace Text Across Your Entire Vault at Once\r\n\r\nTo do this, you can use the free features of different power-users text editors ¬†I use¬†[Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)¬†(PC) and¬†[BBedit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/)¬†(Mac) for multi-file search and replace. They‚Äôre both fast, handle case-matching, and the basic features are free. [Vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is another favorite and it is cross-platform.\r\n\r\n![Search and replace in BBEdit](https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2024/cleanshot-2024-06-01-at-19.51.462x.jpeg)\r\n\r\n## 7. Automatically Sync a Backup Copy of Your Vault to a Cloud Service Every Night While You Sleep\r\n\r\nYou need a couple of utilities to make this happen. The first is a file-syncing utility that runs automatic syncs. I use [Sync Folders Pro](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sync-folders/id530573877), a $9 app from the app store. Then you need an app that automatically launched your sync program. On the Mac you can use [Lingon X,](https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/lingon-x-finds-all-the-junk) [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/) or [Alarm Clock Pro](https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/alarm-clock-pro). [More backup information](https://amerpie.lol/2024/02/11/automating-your-obsidian.html).\r\n\r\n##  8. Import Entire Web Pages with Nothing More Than a URL on The Clipboard\r\n\r\nOne of the features of the [ReadItLater plugin](https://github.com/DominikPieper/obsidian-ReadItLater)is to create a a new based on nothing more than a URL on your clipboard. You just copy an address from a web page you want to save, switch to Obsidian and activate it ReadItLater from the command pallet. It's that fast and that easy. [More ways to import web pages](https://amerpie.lol/2024/03/02/all-the-ways.html)\r\n\r\n## 9. A Wizard to Build Dataview Queries\r\n\r\nThere is a free tool you can use to help with the learning curve with Dataview.¬†[‚ÄúThe Basic Dataview Query Builder](https://s-blu.github.io/basic-dataview-query-builder/)¬†will guide you through some questions and put together a Dataview query based on your answers. You can use this query as-is in your vault or as a starting point to refine a more advanced query.\r\n\r\n## 10. Get Ideas for Notes or Vaults You Can Create in Obsidian\r\n\r\n- [Here's a list of 77 different note types you can create.](https://amerpie.lol/2024/04/28/types-of-notes.html)\r\n- [Here are 15 sample vaults from around the Internet you can download and experiment with.](https://amerpie.lol/2024/05/13/example-obsidian-vaults.html)\r\n",

Use Cool Icons With All of Your Obsidian Folders\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to visually enhance your folders like shown below, install the Iconize community plugin.\r\n\r\n![Obsidian Folders with Icons](https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2024/cleanshot-2024-05-25-at-16.56.372x.jpeg)\r\n\r\n## 8. Import Entire Articles from Omnivore, Not Just Highlights and Notes\r\n\r\nIf you want to use the free red-it-later service to import the entire text of web pages instead of the default behavior which just brings in highlights and notes, you can tweak your article template like this.\r\n\r\n\r\n`````\r\n> # {{{title}}}\r\n> #Omnivore\r\n> \r\n> [Read on Omnivore]({{{omnivoreUrl}}})\r\n> [Read Original]({{{originalUrl}}})\r\n> \r\n> {{#note}}\r\n> \r\n> {{{note}}}\r\n> {{/note}}\r\n> \r\n> {{{ content }}}\r\n`````\r\n## 9. Customize Your Sidebars\r\n\r\nIn Obsidian, you can drag and drop elements like notes, links, or files to the sidebars to move or create new links. Simply drag the element you want to move and drop it onto the sidebar where you want it to be placed.\r\n\r\n![The right sidebar of the Obsidian Window](https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2024/cleanshot-2024-05-25-at-17.04.432x.jpeg)\r\n\r\n## 10. To Add a Geotag and Timestamp to a Note on iOS\r\n\r\nThis one requires Drafts, which all Mac/iOS users should have any way. [This action](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/2Fc) will append the info to your daily note but it is easy to edit to create a note instead of appending it.\n",

You select a folder and provide criteria about what you want to happen to the files and folders in that folder and Hazel periodically checks it and runs the rules. Hazel can move, copy, rename and convert files. Criteria you can use include all of a file&rsquo;s native attributes and even file contents. A lot of folks use it to scan PDFs of their bills for a specific account number and automatically move the file to a folder in their paperless record management system.</p>\n<p>These are my favorite Hazel Actions</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Unzip any compressed files in my Downloads folder and trash the zip file</strong> - This helps keep my downloads folder cleared of the detritus that occurs because I am a compulsive software addict.</li>\n<li><strong>Install apps inside DMGs in my downloads folder via <a href=\"https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/rapidmg-automating-downloads-and-installs\">RapiDMG</a> and then trash the DMG</strong> - When I download a disk image file with an app in it, I don&rsquo;t have to do anything else to get the app moved to my Applications folder. It happens in seconds with no intervention from me unless I have to approve replacing an existing file.</li>\n<li><strong>Import any image file I place in an Images folder into the Photos app (in the background)</strong> - I&rsquo;m constantly copying photos from Facebook and various web sites. I have them to a folder I have designated in Hazel and they automatically get imported into my photos library with me even opening the app.</li>\n<li><strong>Change any text file in my Dropbox to a markdown file and move it to my Obsidian vault (useful in sending emails to Obsidian)</strong> - I use an <a href=\"https://ifttt.com/explore\">IFTTT</a> applet that allows me to forward emails to a specific address. Those emails are save in a specific folder in my Dropbox account that Hazel watches. When a file appears there, Hazel changes the file extension from txt to md and moves the resulting file into my Obsidian vault. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>\n<li><strong>Sort all files in my documents folder into subfolders based on file extension.</strong> - I currently have 42 sub-folders in my documents folder of different file types ranging from the usual suspects like txt and docx to the more esoteric like saved <a href=\"https://www.houdah.com/houdahSpot/\">HoudahSpot</a> searched and <a href=\"https://etrecheck.com/en/index.html\">Etrecheck</a> Reports.</li>\n<li><strong>Purge old screenshots</strong> - between my day job and my blogging past time, I generate a lot of screenshots. Hazel moves any screenshots more than three days old into an archive folder to help give a semblance of order.</li>\n<li><strong>Color code any application I haven&rsquo;t opened in three months</strong> - I have 416 apps installed on my mac because, well, I just can&rsquo;t help myself. Hazel will color an unused app red after not launching it for 90 days to help me decide whether to keep it or remove it with <a href=\"https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/\">AppCleaner</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep my desktop clean</strong> - I do not like to use my desktop as part of my file system. I rarely even see it since I run apps maximized most of the time. This rule moves any file that ends up on my desktop into a folder in my home directory. I exclude aliases from the rule because there are times when I want to make an app shortcut on the desktop, usually temporarily.</li>\n</ol>\n",

A lot of folks use it to scan PDFs of their bills for a specific account number and automatically move the file to a folder in their paperless record management system.\r\n\r\nThese are my favorite Hazel Actions\r\n\r\n1. **Unzip any compressed files in my Downloads folder and trash the zip file** - This helps keep my downloads folder cleared of the detritus that occurs because I am a compulsive software addict. \r\n2. **Install apps inside DMGs in my downloads folder via [RapiDMG](https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/rapidmg-automating-downloads-and-installs) and then trash the DMG** - When I download a disk image file with an app in it, I don't have to do anything else to get the app moved to my Applications folder. It happens in seconds with no intervention from me unless I have to approve replacing an existing file.\r\n3. **Import any image file I place in an Images folder into the Photos app (in the background)** - I'm constantly copying photos from Facebook and various web sites. I have them to a folder I have designated in Hazel and they automatically get imported into my photos library with me even opening the app.\r\n4. **Change any text file in my Dropbox to a markdown file and move it to my Obsidian vault (useful in sending emails to Obsidian)** - I use an [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/explore) applet that allows me to forward emails to a specific address. Those emails are save in a specific folder in my Dropbox account that Hazel watches. When a file appears there, Hazel changes the file extension from txt to md and moves the resulting file into my Obsidian vault. <img src=\"https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2024/hazel.jpeg\" width=\"600\" height=\"324\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A computer desktop screen shows an open file manager window with a list of folders on the left and search options on the right, against a mountainous landscape wallpaper.\">\r\n5. **Sort all files in my documents folder into subfolders based on file extension.** - I currently have 42 sub-folders in my documents folder of different file types ranging from the usual suspects like txt and docx to the more esoteric like saved [HoudahSpot](https://www.houdah.com/houdahSpot/) searched and [Etrecheck](https://etrecheck.com/en/index.html) Reports.\r\n6. **Purge old screenshots** - between my day job and my blogging past time, I generate a lot of screenshots. Hazel moves any screenshots more than three days old into an archive folder to help give a semblance of order.\r\n7. **Color code any application I haven't opened in three months** - I have 416 apps installed on my mac because, well, I just can't help myself. Hazel will color an unused app red after not launching it for 90 days to help me decide whether to keep it or remove it with [AppCleaner](https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/).\r\n8. **Keep my desktop clean** - I do not like to use my desktop as part of my file system. I rarely even see it since I run apps maximized most of the time. This rule moves any file that ends up on my desktop into a folder in my home directory. I exclude aliases from the rule because there are times when I want to make an app shortcut on the desktop, usually temporarily.\r\n",

Once a waypoint is generated, it'll automatically link to every note within the folder and its subfolders. The Waypoint plugin will detect when you create/rename/move/delete a note and automatically stay up-to-date.\n\n\n\n",

It can use the same extensions available to Google Chrome and there&rsquo;s a vast selection to choose from. I don&rsquo;t find that running all these extensions slows Edge down appreciably, so I install what I need. Extensions are specific to the profile you are using, but workspaces within the same profile share the same extensions. You can create a different Mac and PC profile is you find yourself using extensions that are platform specific. Here&rsquo;s what I use:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://omnivore.app/\">Omnivore</a> - It&rsquo;s the best read it later service around these days, featuring a mobile app with read aloud capability, newsletter subscription service, RSS feeds and a browser extension.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/markdownload-markdown-w/hajanaajapkhaabfcofdjgjnlgkdkknm\">MarkDownload</a> - saves Markdown versions of web pages directly into my <a href=\"https://obsidian.med\">Obsidian</a> vault with customized properties</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/perplexity-ai-companion/hlgbcneanomplepojfcnclggenpcoldo\">Perplexity</a> - Although one of the unique features of Edge is the built-in access to Chat-GPT4, I like to use Perplexity as well. It&rsquo;s a popular extension with over 200K downloads.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://app.raindrop.io/\">Raindrop.io</a> - I have a subscription and heartily endorse Raindrop.io for it&rsquo;s cross platform support as well as its <a href=\"https://ifttt.com/raindrop\">IFTTT</a> integration which really helps me when I&rsquo;m researching anything</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://aboard.com/extension/\">Aboard</a> - This is the extension for the app my wife and I use to share links with each other. When I find an app, a TV show, a news story or whatever, I put it into Aboard and she gets a notification and can check it out when she has time. It&rsquo;s free and useful.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://remotedesktop.google.com/\">Chrome Remote Desktop</a> - This allows me to access my home computer from other locations. It&rsquo;s free, easy to set up and use and reliable. I don&rsquo;t know what people pay for <a href=\"https://www.edovia.com/en/screens/\">Screens</a> or <a href=\"https://www.teamviewer.com/en/\">TeamViewer</a> subscriptions.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm\">UBlock Origin</a>- The best ad blocker on the planet. 31,000,000 downloads can&rsquo;t be wrong.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.gettoby.com/\">Toby</a> - My new tab extension. It makes it easy to save and open windows full of tabs on the go. I use the free version and even though I maintain my <a href=\"https://start.me/\">start.me</a> page, I stick with Toby for new tabs.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/velja/gpipdgcamiclkcomcnogmlfpalggmcmk\">Velja</a> - Works in conjunction with the Mac app of the same name to open URLs in other bowsers and apps (e.g., Slack, Teams, Zoom, Freetube etc)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.lastpass.com/\">Lastpass</a> - I&rsquo;ve had a paid account shared with my wife for more than a decade. Lastpass has gotten some bad PR due to a couple of incidents, but I haven&rsquo;t had any issues. Still, peer pressure is getting to me and I&rsquo;m looking to switch to Bitwarden when my subscription is up.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/archive-page/llldbgankiiaiobhnjpbllpijlidinaf\">Archive page</a> - An indispensable extension for getting around paywalled content.

LOL</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/simplify-gmail/mpohnjhkncdalhjdhpiphajhiahmcapn\">Simplify Gmail</a>- The only extension I pay for.

You can create a different Mac and PC profile is you find yourself using extensions that are platform specific. Here's what I use:\r\n\r\n- [Omnivore](https://omnivore.app/) - It's the best read it later service around these days, featuring a mobile app with read aloud capability, newsletter subscription service, RSS feeds and a browser extension.\r\n- [MarkDownload](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/markdownload-markdown-w/hajanaajapkhaabfcofdjgjnlgkdkknm) - saves Markdown versions of web pages directly into my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.med) vault with customized properties\r\n- [Perplexity](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/perplexity-ai-companion/hlgbcneanomplepojfcnclggenpcoldo) - Although one of the unique features of Edge is the built-in access to Chat-GPT4, I like to use Perplexity as well. It's a popular extension with over 200K downloads.\r\n- [Raindrop.io](https://app.raindrop.io/) - I have a subscription and heartily endorse Raindrop.io for it's cross platform support as well as its [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/raindrop) integration which really helps me when I'm researching anything\r\n- [Aboard](https://aboard.com/extension/) - This is the extension for the app my wife and I use to share links with each other. When I find an app, a TV show, a news story or whatever, I put it into Aboard and she gets a notification and can check it out when she has time. It's free and useful.\r\n- [Chrome Remote Desktop](https://remotedesktop.google.com/) - This allows me to access my home computer from other locations. It's free, easy to set up and use and reliable. I don't know what people pay for [Screens](https://www.edovia.com/en/screens/) or [TeamViewer](https://www.teamviewer.com/en/) subscriptions.\r\n- [UBlock Origin](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm)- The best ad blocker on the planet. 31,000,000 downloads can't be wrong.\r\n- [Toby](https://www.gettoby.com/) - My new tab extension. It makes it easy to save and open windows full of tabs on the go. I use the free version and even though I maintain my [start.me](https://start.me/) page, I stick with Toby for new tabs.\r\n- [Velja](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/velja/gpipdgcamiclkcomcnogmlfpalggmcmk) - Works in conjunction with the Mac app of the same name to open URLs in other bowsers and apps (e.g., Slack, Teams, Zoom, Freetube etc)\r\n- [Lastpass](https://www.lastpass.com/) - I've had a paid account shared with my wife for more than a decade. Lastpass has gotten some bad PR due to a couple of incidents, but I haven't had any issues. Still, peer pressure is getting to me and I'm looking to switch to Bitwarden when my subscription is up.\r\n- [Archive page](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/archive-page/llldbgankiiaiobhnjpbllpijlidinaf) - An indispensable extension for getting around paywalled content. I use it multiple times a dat for [Medium](https://medium.com/) posts and [Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/) articles.\r\n- [Postlight Reader](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/postlight-reader/kpldbdfpngbdadafgaccakmeaoeligcl) - The Postlight Reader extension for Microsoft Edge removes ads and distractions, leaving only text and images for a clean and consistent reading view on every site.\r\n- [Reddit Enhancement Suite](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/reddit-enhancement-suite/jlhgedjpndhblehblebhncfmkkpngiep) - I use this for one primary reason - to block pictures of other people's graphs on the [Obsidian subreddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/). LOL\r\n- [Simplify Gmail](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/simplify-gmail/mpohnjhkncdalhjdhpiphajhiahmcapn)- The only extension I pay for. It has hundreds of improvements (small and large) to streamline, simplify, and enhance Gmail's design and functionality. Hide the features you don't use, customize the ones you do including setting the list and message width and fonts.\r\n- [Raycast](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fgacdjnoljjfikkadhogeofgjoglooma) - Built-in page summary for [Raycast Pro](https://www.raycast.com/)users.\r\n- [ChatGPT for Google](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/emjhillblkjkhnclfgcahgdhjmdmeohj)- Adds a simultaneous ChatGPT search when you look for something at Google.com.\r\n- [Web Time Tracker](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/webtime-tracker/ppaojnbmmaigjmlpjaldnkgnklhicppk) - Provides stats on how much time you spend on web sites\r\n- [Street Pass for Mastodon](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/streetpass-for-mastodon/fphjfedjhinpnjblomfebcjjpdpakhhn)- StreetPass is a browser extension that helps you find your people on Mastodon. Here's how it works:\r\n\t1. Mastodon users verify themselves by adding a custom link to their personal site.\r\n\t2. StreetPass lets you know when you've found one of these links, and adds them to your StreetPass list.\r\n\t3. Browse the web as usual. StreetPass will build a list of Mastodon users made up of the websites you go to.\r\n",

				"content_html": "<p><img src=\"https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2024/cleanshot-2024-04-15-at-19.57.332x.jpeg\" alt=\"A list of Mac applications that run at startup\"></p>\n<p>We buy our computers in order to use them. Some of them get used at work so that we can earn a living. In a lot of ways they are like shovels or hammers, just tools, a means to an end. Some computers are used for a different purpose. They help us express our creativity through art, photography, poetry. They provide us a link to the news of the world, whatever world it is that we wish to live in, be it some ancient kingdom in a video game or up to the minute events in politics and war or maybe just the lives of our friends online and in real life. We get to decide. We get to choose the tools, in the form of software that we are going to use to have the experience on our computer that we want to have. In the end, it&rsquo;s all subjective. Maybe you can write a best-selling novel with TextEdit and use nothing but the stock out of the box apps on your Mac. Some do. Others, however, look for the tools that fit their styles and meet their needs in a particular way. There is no right and wrong.</p>\n<p>There are a few things that people in the Windows world get that we don&rsquo;t. Windows has a built-in clipboard manager. It has Windows management tools. We can have those things, we just have to find an app to do them for us. Most often those apps are installed so that they run when you log in to your computer. I&rsquo;m going to list the tools I want available to me when I&rsquo;m on my laptop. Every single program in the list runs as a login item on my Mac. Undoubtably, some people are going to be SMDH. Well, IDGAF. This is what it takes for me to have the experience I want.

				"content_text": "![A list of Mac applications that run at startup](https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2024/cleanshot-2024-04-15-at-19.57.332x.jpeg)\r\n\r\nWe buy our computers in order to use them. Some of them get used at work so that we can earn a living. In a lot of ways they are like shovels or hammers, just tools, a means to an end. Some computers are used for a different purpose. They help us express our creativity through art, photography, poetry. They provide us a link to the news of the world, whatever world it is that we wish to live in, be it some ancient kingdom in a video game or up to the minute events in politics and war or maybe just the lives of our friends online and in real life. We get to decide. We get to choose the tools, in the form of software that we are going to use to have the experience on our computer that we want to have. In the end, it's all subjective. Maybe you can write a best-selling novel with TextEdit and use nothing but the stock out of the box apps on your Mac. Some do. Others, however, look for the tools that fit their styles and meet their needs in a particular way. There is no right and wrong. \r\n\r\nThere are a few things that people in the Windows world get that we don't. Windows has a built-in clipboard manager. It has Windows management tools. We can have those things, we just have to find an app to do them for us. Most often those apps are installed so that they run when you log in to your computer. I'm going to list the tools I want available to me when I'm on my laptop. Every single program in the list runs as a login item on my Mac. Undoubtably, some people are going to be SMDH. Well, IDGAF. This is what it takes for me to have the experience I want. I've been using a Mac for a minute (I'm a retired Mac sysadmin from the public school system) and if an app has any kind of notoriety, I've probably tried it. Some of these apps are available on SetApp, if that's something you're interested in.

Whenever I launched the app, it would take thirty seconds to a minute to load, making it really impractical to use for quick capture. Looking for a better experience, I opted to switch to the paid Obsidian sync ($4 month). Unfortunately as I imported more notes into my vault from my previous app of choice, Evernote, it got to the point where Obsidian would not even load. It just looped into a never-ending series of crashes. The only solution I could find was to delete my files from local storage and re-download them from the cloud.</p>\n<h2 id=\"troubleshooting\">Troubleshooting</h2>\n<p>I turned to ChatGPT for help and got this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Limit your file sizes:</strong> While Obsidian is capable of handling large text files, having too many or very large files can slow down the app. Try to limit your notes to a reasonable size, and split up longer notes into smaller ones if possible.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduce the number of plugins:</strong> While plugins can add a lot of functionality to Obsidian, they can also slow it down if you have too many running at once. Try disabling any non-essential plugins to see if that improves performance.</li>\n<li><strong>Clear Cache</strong>: Sometimes the application cache gets clogged up and causes performance issues. Go into your iPhone settings &gt; General &gt; iPhone Storage &gt; Obsidian and then tap on &lsquo;Offload App&rsquo;. This will delete the app but keep all its documents and data. Then reinstall Obsidian from App Store.</li>\n<li><strong>Avoid complex queries:</strong> If you&rsquo;re using Dataview or similar plugins, try to avoid overly complex queries that might be putting a strain on the app.</li>\n<li><strong>Close background apps:</strong> Other apps running in the background could be affecting Obsidian&rsquo;s performance. Close any unnecessary apps before launching Obsidian.</li>\n<li><strong>Update iOS &amp; App:</strong> Make sure both your operating system and your app are updated to their latest versions as performance improvements are often part of updates.</li>\n<li><strong>Contact Support:</strong> If none of these tips help, it may be worth reaching out to Obsidian&rsquo;s support team directly for assistance with this issue.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Remember that syncing large amounts of data can take time and resources, so try not to overload it by adding too many new files at once or making lots of edits in a short space of time.</p>\n<p>I was kind of dubious, especially of number 5, since on iOS there really isn&rsquo;t anything like a background app. It doesn&rsquo;t work that way. I also didn&rsquo;t have any really large notes. I turned off all the plugins I didn&rsquo;t absolutely need. I wasn&rsquo;t sure what constituted a complex Dataview query. Most of mine seem simple enough, looking only for a single criteria, usually a tag. I was running the latest version of iOS and of the public release of Obsidian. My results weren&rsquo;t that different after trying these steps so I decided to contact Obsidian support, seeing how it&rsquo;s a benefit for those who pay for sync.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-official-take\">The Official Take</h2>\n<p>The response from support was quick and honest. The person who wrote me acknowledged the issues and said they were being addressed in an upcoming release. She also said &ldquo;However, it is worth noting that depending on the size of your vault, and what plugins you are using, you may be running to out of cache memory issues on this older device (remember I was rocking a four-year old phone). Obsidian is not the most lightweight of applications. D:</p>\n<p>Known amplifiers of this case:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Using heavier memory plugins like Dataview and Metabind</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Enabling the backlinks core plugin on mobile</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Enabling the graph view core plugin on mobile</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Having the vault also be in iCloud on mobile</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Known alleviations of this case separate from above:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Backing up your vault, and reinstalling Obsidian on mobile if your current install of the application was pre 17.0</strong>.&rdquo;</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"the-solution\">The Solution</h2>\n<p>I did everything tech support suggested and guess what? The problem didn&rsquo;t get any better. For me and the way I use Obsidian, an iPhone 11 wasn&rsquo;t going to cut it. I ordered an upgrade, to the 15 Pro Max and since then I haven&rsquo;t had to resort to deleting and redownloading my files. I still have to wait awhile when I launch the app while things load and sync, but it becomes useable much more quickly. I tend to use <a href=\"https://getdrafts.com/\">Drafts</a>for quick capture since it&rsquo;s so easy to move notes from there into my vault. I still have backlinks and graph view turned off and I don&rsquo;t sync certain folder that have lots of attachments. I don&rsquo;t really need my recipe collection on my phone anyway.</p>\n",

Close any unnecessary apps before launching Obsidian.\r\n6. **Update iOS & App:** Make sure both your operating system and your app are updated to their latest versions as performance improvements are often part of updates.\r\n7. **Contact Support:** If none of these tips help, it may be worth reaching out to Obsidian's support team directly for assistance with this issue.\r\n\r\nRemember that syncing large amounts of data can take time and resources, so try not to overload it by adding too many new files at once or making lots of edits in a short space of time.\r\n\r\nI was kind of dubious, especially of number 5, since on iOS there really isn't anything like a background app. It doesn't work that way. I also didn't have any really large notes. I turned off all the plugins I didn't absolutely need. I wasn't sure what constituted a complex Dataview query. Most of mine seem simple enough, looking only for a single criteria, usually a tag. I was running the latest version of iOS and of the public release of Obsidian. My results weren't that different after trying these steps so I decided to contact Obsidian support, seeing how it's a benefit for those who pay for sync.\r\n\r\n## The Official Take\r\n\r\nThe response from support was quick and honest. The person who wrote me acknowledged the issues and said they were being addressed in an upcoming release. She also said \"However, it is worth noting that depending on the size of your vault, and what plugins you are using, you may be running to out of cache memory issues on this older device (remember I was rocking a four-year old phone). Obsidian is not the most lightweight of applications. D:  \r\n\r\nKnown amplifiers of this case:  \r\n\r\n- **Using heavier memory plugins like Dataview and Metabind**  \r\n- **Enabling the backlinks core plugin on mobile**  \r\n- **Enabling the graph view core plugin on mobile**  \r\n- **Having the vault also be in iCloud on mobile**  \r\n\r\nKnown alleviations of this case separate from above:  \r\n\r\n- **Backing up your vault, and reinstalling Obsidian on mobile if your current install of the application was pre 17.0**.\"\r\n## The Solution\r\n\r\nI did everything tech support suggested and guess what? The problem didn't get any better. For me and the way I use Obsidian, an iPhone 11 wasn't going to cut it. I ordered an upgrade, to the 15 Pro Max and since then I haven't had to resort to deleting and redownloading my files. I still have to wait awhile when I launch the app while things load and sync, but it becomes useable much more quickly. I tend to use [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/)for quick capture since it's so easy to move notes from there into my vault. I still have backlinks and graph view turned off and I don't sync certain folder that have lots of attachments. I don't really need my recipe collection on my phone anyway. \n",
