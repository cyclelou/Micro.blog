				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"uploads/2025/47788.webp\" alt=\"Men Yelling\" /></p>\n<p>Since I became politically active in the 90s, I've dealt with some pretty harsh behavior from people who didn't like my views. I'm not just talking about conservatives, either. When I was organizing veterans and military families against the war in Iraq was the worst. I live beside the most populated military base in the United States and even though I'm a vet with two kids who also served, plenty of people were pissed about anyone here openly opposing the war machine. I got death threats in the mail, my car window was shot out in my driveway, and I got some nasty notes taped to my door at work. Other than that, I've just had to deal with the normal name-calling and harassment many lefties endure. Recently, someone added my name to three moderation lists on Bluesky, labeling me a MAGA troll, a porn spammer and accusing me of some sex thing that I was scared to look up.</p>\n<p>On the flip side, if you've never been involved in left politics, you have no idea how people on our side can be vicious to each other in stupid purity tests. I've been accused by people who I wanted to be allies with of being insufficiently supportive of Palestine, women, LGBT rights, the environment, the Iraqi resistance and more. The worst people weren't far-left folks, though. The ugliest, most mean-spirited comments I've ever dealt with came from Blue State liberals who think every person in the south is a MAGA loving moron. I've seen people from NY and California and other places literally celebrate natural disasters in NC, including Hurricane Helene last October. I've been told that if I was a real Democrat, that I would move and never talk to anyone from NC again. These superior types don't even realize we have a Democratic governor and AG or that the state GOP has had more than a dozen voter suppression and gerrymandering laws eventually overturned.</p>\n<p>I believe in accountability and responsibility. I don't accept unacceptable behavior from people who think that just a bit of fascism or racism is OK. I'm mad at the state of my country, and I feel like lashing out more than is probably healthy. I also know this stuff is complicated and the practical application of my political values and societies expectations are difficult to balance if I turn off the bravado for a minute.</p>\n<p>I fantasize about being able to act on the anger I feel about the political state we are in.  I'd like to be able to call out every person who has done anything to enable the hateful policies that (white) people are applauding. I would like to refuse to deal with people with backwards views on gender, race, and immigration status. If they want to take food away from hungry kids or medical care away from sick people, I would like to be able to write them out of my life loudly and publicly because they deserve it.</p>\n<p>But let's step back into reality for a minute.</p>\n<p>I live in one of the larger cities in North Carolina. It votes reliably blue, as do most of the cities of its size in the state. The surrounding rural areas are as red as can be, including the county that employed me for twenty years. Even here in town., many of the residents are former or retired military and most of the white ones are Republicans. If you tried to gauge elections by yard signs, the GOP would win every time. It is not an echo chamber in any way. Conservatives and liberals live and work side by side.</p>\n<p>I am very openly on the progressive side, with the appropriate bumper stickers and snide remarks about Republican policy every once in a while. I don't cross the line at work (anymore) but I walk right up to it. Always have. I try to let me fellow white people know that I am not in their club. I'm not the one you come to complain about diversity hiring or to whine about Joe Biden being responsible for egg prices. I will absolutely get loud when subjected to backwards behavior but correcting every non-woke opinion in others is not my life's mission.</p>\n<p>I have someone close to me who is lucky enough to live in Austin, TX. He worked for Samsung for 15 years. When the Tesla Gigafactory was built, which was before the company CEO bought Twitter and revealed himself to be a fascist, recruiters for the EV maker made him an attractive offer which he accepted. It was a great opportunity for someone with no degree to get a job in a green industry, making a sizable six-figure salary with stock options vesting in a few years and potential bonuses to offset the two kids he's single-handedly putting through school. He is 100% aware of the behavior of the man at the head of his company's food chain. He does not defend him.</p>\n<p>Most of the people in my family who stay informed about politics  and have an opinion, lean left, but both of my parents are Republicans, although Mom isn't a Trump voter. One of my Dad's bothers is also conservative, and he happens to be the person responsible for me reaching adulthood without going into the juvenile justice system or foster care. He's the only person in my family who goes to a multi-racial church. He's just constitutionally incapable of voting for a Democrat because we'll take away his hunting rifle…or something. It makes me sad.</p>\n<p>I'd like to boast about having come out of the womb with  a natural inclination towards perfect politics, but I didn't. I didn't develop any strong political feelings until I was almost 30. I voted for one of the worst Republicans in history when I was 19 out of pure ignorance. I even skipped a couple of elections. I believe I've done an adequate job in the past 30 years of achieving redemption with the help of committed activists and mentors and my own open mind. Someone had to educate me about the backwardness and ignorance I lived in on a whole list of topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unions</li>\n<li>Israel/Palestine</li>\n<li>US Military Policy</li>\n<li>Criminal justice</li>\n<li>White privilege</li>\n<li>Affirmative action</li>\n<li>LGBT rights</li>\n<li>Patriarchy</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'm not going to confess every sin I've ever committed against the values I hold today, but there were many, from the horrible use of inappropriate language to joining the army and working in a prison. It took what it took to get me where I am today, but, yeah, I wish I'd gotten here sooner and with less baggage. I am not a unique or special case. I know others who've had journeys similar to my own. We made the most of our leaning opportunities and came out better for it. We learned to forgive ourselves, and we didn't defend our former attitudes.</p>\n<p>This is not the paragraph where I am going to wrap everything up into a neat package and hand it to you so that you know what to do. I wish I knew. I know that as angry as I am, I also have to practice empathy, understanding, and forgiveness, or I'll just be a shitty excuse for a person. I also have to resist the urge to just get along with people and take the easier and softer way of ignoring things that need to be dealt with. It's a balancing act and a hard one. Just do the best you can and act from a loving place as much as possible,<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

It scours the web every\nhour to search for articles using my keywords. I have monitoring feeds\nto help me track my favorite software titles for news and tips/tricks.\nThe wizard that creates these feeds lets me decide whether I want to\nsearch entire articles or just titles. I can search the entire Internet\nor just sources from sites whose main RSS feed I follow. As with all\nfeeds on Inoreader, I can set up a highlighter for my search terms\n(Obsidian, Raycast, Keyboard Maestro, Micro.blog). I can filter out\nterms I definitely do not find interesting (Android, Apple Vision Pro,\nTrump). Finally, I can filter out duplicates and near duplicates so my\nfeed doesn&#39;t get inundated on dates when one of my keywords makes the\nnews, for example when updates to a certain title get released. It is\npossible to place all these keyword monitoring feeds into a folder and\nto view the output combined. I can even generate an OPML file with the\noutput to share with others!</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Newsletter Subscription Replacement</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Inoreader allows me to generate email addresses to use in\n<strong>subscribing to newsletters</strong>. That way, I get the benefit\nof their content without having my mailbox clogged up. Like every other\nfeed, these newsletters can be saved to OneDrive, Dropbox or Google\nDrive. I can export them to Pocket or ReadWise, Instapaper, Blogger,\nTelegram, Twitter, Facebook, Mastodon or a custom location.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Automation</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>If you highlight text in any RSS article or newsletter, you can use the\nhighlight to <strong>trigger an IFTTT applet</strong>. You can do the\nsame with any article you mark to read later. In fact, IFTTT has a dozen\ndifferent triggers for Inoreader and over 2000 services you can connect\nit to. You can read your feeds in a web browser or in your choice of RSS\nreaders like Reeder or NetNewsWire. I like their web interface so much\nthat on a desktop, I choose to use a stand-alone web app of their site\nto read my feeds since it has easy access to most of the extra features\noffered. On my iPhone and iPad, I use their app as opposed to a separate\nRSS reader. Their iOS and Android apps have an offline mode allowing you\nto download content to read later, useful for flights and helping you\navoid a separate subscription to a read it late service.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Organization and Backup</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>You can use folders or tags (or both) to organize your feeds. You can\nset up notifications for different keywords or material from certain\nsources. In the settings section of the Inoreader you can look at the\nhealth of all of your feeds and easily determine if one is down,\nallowing you to contact the blogger or publisher of the site in\nquestion. If you currently have an RSS provider or reader, Inoreader can\neasily import your feeds and conversely, it can export feeds for you if\nyou want to use them elsewhere. Your feeds get backed up every day, and\nyou can set them to be saved to a cloud folder synced with your computer\nso you can have ready access to them. I use Dropbox for this.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Other Features</em></strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Built in podcast player</li>\n<li>Turn Google News searches into feeds</li>\n<li>Customize the look with your own CSS if desired</li>\n<li>Get accelerated updates on certain feeds</li>\n<li>Annotate and save articles</li>\n<li>Multi-lingual content</li>\n<li>Sync your YouTube subscriptions</li>\n<li>Filtered Reddit feeds (see Obsidian posts without having to look at pictures of other people's graphs)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Pricing for all the features I mentioned is $7.50 a month, paid\nannually. You can download Inoreader for iOS and iPadOS <a\nhref=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/inoreader-news-rss-reader/id892355414\">on\nthe App Store.</a></p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Inoreader RSS Gets New Features' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",
