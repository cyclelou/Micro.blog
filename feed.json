				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/10-1.webp\" alt=\"Door kicked open by workers\" /></p>\n<p>In September 1991, I was working first shift at the medium-sized prison that had employed me for the previous five years. My co-workers were a mixed group of white folks, African Americans, Native Americans and one officer from Puerto Rico. Most of us had served in the military. Almost none of us had any college. Our spouses worked in various places: the few remaining textile mills, a Converse shoe plant and various chicken and turkey processing facilities, including Imperial Foods, located in Hamlet, NC, about 30 miles away. We'd finished the inmates' breakfast meal and were in the process of getting the prison through its daily cleaning when the switchboard starting putting through calls to the officers wive's who worked at Imperial. Something bad had happened, a fire. Over 100 firefighters had been called in, and the news was grim. There were many, many people on route to the hospital, many missing and the first bodies were being brought out. We had to call in people from second shift to come in early, so the worried husbands could get to the site of the fire.</p>\n<p>During the next few days, the survivors began to tell the story of the rapidly spreading fire that was fueled by an ad hoc repair to a hydraulic line that burst right next to a sizzling hot fryer for cooking chicken. Few people knew that although the plant had two previous fires within the last decade, it had never had a state safety inspection. As the workers fled, they encountered locked and chained fire exits, closed at the order of the company's owner, who was worried about people stealing food from his company. Only one group of employees managed to kick open a door. That door, covered in sooty boot prints, is on display today at the museum of American History in Washington, DC. It bears testament to one of the deadliest industrial disasters in state history. Of the 90 people inside Imperial Foods when the fire broke out, 25 died and 54 were injured, many of them suffering lifelong ill effects from smoke and chemical inhalation.</p>\n<p>Eventually, the owner of the plant, Emmet Roe was charged with 25 counts of manslaughter, He pled guilty and was sentenced to 20 years, of which he served only four. He was also fined the equivalent of $1.8 million. The plant was permanently closed. Based in part on public outrage, Jim Martin, only the state's second Republican governor in 100 years, nearly doubled the number of industrial inspectors to make workplace inspections more common.</p>\n<p>The Hamlet fire is remarkable because it actually resulted in some accountability and change. For years, American companies scoffed at toothless safety laws and the relative impotence of inspectors. Paying fines was easier than paying for safe working conditions. There is an ongoing and concerted effort currently under way to cut through the so-called red tape of government regulations that supposedly make it too difficult to do business. Many of the regulations are ones created for worker safety. The state of Texas repealed a regulation that mandated water breaks for outdoor workers in the middle of a record-breaking heatwave of 100+ degree days. It interfered with worker productivity.</p>\n<p>Even before the US elected a 34x convicted felon to be its president, most people were already aware of the two tiered justice system under which this country operates. We saw Bill Cosby released from prison despite evidence of dozens of sexual assaults. We saw Trump pardon crony after crony. Even in the local news in my hometown, there have long been reports of the wives of generals from the nearby Army base, Ft. Liberty (née Bragg) getting traffic tickets fixed, of the sons of prominent businessmen getting caught with drugs and guns at a public school and getting away scott free. The owner of a local car dealership not only bought his way out of charges for sexually abusing a 14-year-old boy, the judge would not allow the records of the court proceedings to be made public in violation of state open records laws. It's an old story and one that gets repeated frequently.</p>\n<p>When I see a rich and powerful person get real justice and pay a tangible price for decisions that have had horrible effects on working-class people, I really don't care whether the punishment was extrajudicial or not. The system we have is designed not to punish the powerful, but to keep the poor in line. Eat the rich doesn't have to be an idle threat.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/linkage/022x-resized.webp\" alt=\"CEO_murder\" /></p>\n<p>It's common knowledge that the for-profit medical industrial complex in the United States is broken and has been so for a long time. Bills are inscrutable. Insurance companies provide little help when trying to determine the cost of care patients are considering, if they have that luxury. There may be occasional bright spots, but almost everyone who deals with the system has a personal horror story. For-profit companies are beholden to their stockholders, not patients, you know—sick people. Even non-profits have dubious decision-making skills. I am in long-term (16-year) recovery from substance abuse. I have a mood disorder that requires me to take medication daily. It's no big deal. I was diagnosed in the '80s, so I've dealt with it almost all my adult life. I once got a letter from my insurance company that explained they noticed how expensive my medication was. They suggested I ask the doctor to prescribe Valium instead, a highly addictive and often abused drug. They suggested that to me, a recovering addict.</p>\n<p>I dealt with bone-on-bone arthritis for years. The only relief was a shot that I could get every six months. The red tape, delays, and stalling by my insurance company (I was a state employee in NC) would often result in delays of two to three months, stretching the time between shots up to nine months. Arthritis is a painful and debilitating condition that doesn't just get better. The policies of a company trying to save money resulted in my being denied coverage I was promised as part of my employment. I lived in pain and grew depressed when I met so many stone walls. This went on for years.</p>\n<p>I am sorry that the CEO of United Healthcare was murdered in the street outside of a meeting for investors in that company. I am not surprised, though. If I thought some exorbitantly paid executive was responsible for the pain, suffering, and death of someone I loved because his company was trying to provide maximum value to shareholders, I might just consider violence myself.</p>\n<p><a href='https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-03-health-ceos-rake-millions.html'>Health insurance CEOs rake in millions: Here's the top 10 list</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://archive.ph/JFUgz'>How Insurance Companies Get You to Pay Higher Costs for Less Coverage</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://perfectunion.us/whistleblower-exposes-health-insurance-companies-most-evil-scheme/'>Whistleblower Exposes Health Insurers' Most Evil Scheme</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://akasa.com/blog/3-medical-billing-horror-stories-that-prove-the-healthcare-revenue-cycle-is-way-too-complicated/'>3 Medical Billing Horror Stories that Prove the Healthcare Revenue Cycle Is Way Too Complicated | AKASA</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/health-insurance-horror-stories/2/'>Health insurance horror stories</a><BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

For big groups of people, the progress made in gender equity, civil rights, LGBT rights and other areas was much too hard fought to ever consider going back. I am very fond of progress, technology and medical advances. I'm happy to live in a time when HIV is no longer a death sentence. Likewise, I resent the hell out of the empty-headed RFK's of the world who poison people's minds with their anti-vax rhetoric. Having said all of that, I will admit to missing little pieces of the past.</p>\n<p>I miss affordable prices a lot. Getting any beverage in a restaurant costs several dollars. I saw an app today that does one simple thing for Mac users. It toggles a feature (the FN key) on and off. The developer was asking a modest twenty-five dollars for the privilege of using it. As someone who has owned several thousand-dollar cars and who currently drives a 2005 Camry, I am outraged at the people who think a $30K car is cheap. The margin on simple things like shoes and eyeglass frames is robbery by another name. Going to the movies, a concert or a ball game is outrageous. I know, I know. Get off my lawn.</p>\n<p>I miss the time when our society wasn't polarized about politics the way it is today. Sorry, Obama, there definitely is a red America and a blue America. I can't even.</p>\n<p>I miss the time when people could live off a single income earned by a high school graduate. I supported my wife and son in the 80s by framing houses and serving in the National Guard. Twenty-five years later, my youngest daughter and her husband both worked full-time and had a lower standard of living than we did back in the day. </p>\n<p>Oddly enough, in my own experience, racial self-segregation was less pronounced in the 80s than it is now. At my high school, the sports teams, student government and clubs were all diverse. Over the past forty years, I've watched the younger generation choose to have white and black clubs and white and black activities. Other POC just try to get in where they fit in. By the time my kids got to high school, the football team was almost all POC, while the cheerleading squad was lily-white.</p>\n<p>I miss the days when security wasn't the overarching, ever present concern in tech. The impediment to efficiency at work because of security is huge. We can't put local admin accounts with static passwords on workstations to facilitate getting access to them. They have to use a server generated rotating password that I have to look up whenever I need to do something. I can't even use an admin account to log in on my own computer (on the PC side). I have to elevate privileges using my super-extra long admin password to each app I need. Two-factor authentication is neat, as long as it works. The aggravation of dealing with people who get new phones or have other hardware issues is just another wrinkle.

Having been involved with social movements and protests over the last quarter of a century, I'm aware of the conservative attitude towards any group of people who don't wrap themselves in the flag. Modern police forces are terrified of ANTIFA and anarchists while they simultaneously ignore or tacitly support right-wing groups. Republican led legislatures across the country have passed laws designed to crack down on protests and those laws are always enforced selectively against POC, the poor, young people and anyone who opposes the power structure. Some states have made it legal for drivers to run over protesters who block traffic, essentially creating a de facto death penalty. Such is the morality of the \"all lives matter\" crowd.</p>\n<p>For information about role models from the past, see these links.</p>\n<p><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_resistance_to_Nazism'>German resistance to Nazism - Wikipedia</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/german-resistance-to-hitler'>German Resistance to Hitler | Holocaust Encyclopedia</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/brief-history-anti-fascism-180975152/'>A Brief History of Anti-Fascism | Smithsonian</a><BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

Here\nare a few that I&#39;ve found lately.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://fnable.com/en/\">FNable</a> - If you use your function\nkeys much, you may grow tired of having to toggle them with the FN key.\nBe default, macOS treats function keys as system controls. This little\napp allows you to toggle the behavior simply be pressing and holding the\nFN key for three seconds. You definitely want to find this app on sale\nthough. It is regularly priced at a whopping $25 . It is currently\navailable at <a\nhref=\"https://bundlehunt.com/bundle/2024-blackfriday-macos-bundle\">Bundlehunt</a>\nfor $1.50.</p>\n\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/quill-notes-app/id6496970950?mt=12\">Quill</a>\n- Quill is a menu bar notes app similar to <a\nhref=\"https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/scrap-paper\">Scrap Paper</a>and\n<a\nhref=\"https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/scratchpad-floating-notes-but-better\">Scratchpad</a>\nwith one big difference, you can use images in Quill notes. The notes\nsync across Macs, but there isn&#39;t an iOS app. You can, however, export\nyour Quill notes easily enough if you want to view them on your phone.\nIt is $.99 in the App Store.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://trace-app.pages.dev/\">Trace</a> - Trace is a minimalist\ntime tracking app. When you manually start a session of, it records the\napps you work on and the time you spend in them. You can pause and\nresume sessions. It reports the amount of time you spend in each app and\nother facts, like your most used app. It is a free app. For more\ndetailed automatic reports, try <a\nhref=\"https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/activity-watch-free-no-effort-time-tracker\">Activity\nWatch,</a> also free.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://spacesaver.gurubag.com/\">SpaceSaver</a> - With\nSpaceSaver, you can save the state of your open applications and\nwindows, and easily restore them later. You can have multiple sessions\nand switch between them with ease.

It Neither Loves Nor Hates You</strong> - I am all for the power of positive thinking. I tend to act as if things are going to turn out my way most of the time. Pessimistic people, and you surely know a Debbie Downer or two, are a drag to be around, and they grate on my nerves after a while. I am not a Pollyanna, though. I do not believe that \"everything will be all right\" because I am fully aware that I could be in a car accident on the way home or that my house could burn down tonight. Bad things happen to good people every day. What I believe, based on evidence, is my absolute ability to deal with whatever happens. I have a proven track record of living through everything that has ever happened to me. Everything can be overcome. If you don't believe that, read <em>Mans Search for Meaning</em> about how concentration camp inmates survived.</p>\n<p><strong>People Are the Most Powerful When They Are Organized</strong> - Most of the rights and privileges we enjoy today, our freedoms, if you will, were not won on the battlefield. They were won on picket lines and in mass movements against the entrenched power structure. The rights of women, people of color, children, workers and the 99% were won by organized groups of people who strategized, struggled and fought and sometimes died to demand rights we take for granted today. The powerful know this and do their best to keep us divided along racial, cultural and class lines so that we won't do it again.</p>\n<p><strong>It Is Possible to Overcome Nature and Nurture</strong> - We are not locked into an immutable set of values instilled in us by our genetics or our environment. Free will is a hell of a drug, to paraphrase Rick James. I am a son of the South. I have been surrounded by conservative Christianity, institutional white supremacy, patriarchal behavior patterns and unquestioning nationalism my entire life, but I am not an adherent to any of it. The easier and softer way is to go with the flow. Don't make waves. Accept the status quo. Countless people can't even define their belief system because they are too damned busy getting ready for the next MCU movie or the coming weekend's football games. I'm sure there are areas where I need to increase my awareness too, but I try as best I can to be a part of the solution to society's problems. I am not neutral about much.</p>\n<p><strong>Curiosity and Sense of Humor are The Most Attractive Human Traits</strong> - I'm not an education major. I haven't studied learning styles, but I know there are plenty of ways to add to one's personal knowledge base. Whether it's reading books, surfing the Internet, interrogating the people in your life, or something else, there are an infinite number of things to learn. People who have a sense of wonder and a thirst for knowledge are my favorites. When that is coupled with the ability to laugh, to see the absurd, and to enjoy little moments of serendipity, it's hard for me not to be drawn towards a person.</p>\n<p><strong>When You Live a Fearful Life, You're Living Like All the Bad Things Have Already Happened to You</strong> - I am firmly in the camp with those who believe that asking for forgiveness is easier than asking for permission. I do not have on ongoing CYA strategy at work or in my private life. There is something inauthentic and sad about people who constantly self-censor or wait for others to make decisions for them. Granted, I am not rich nor am I a CIO. What I am is generally happy and productive, with plenty of room in my mind for things that I enjoy. I believe in acting in good faith. My experience has shown me that doing so is what works for me, more so than endless plotting to get ahead and avoid ruffling feathers. I feel confident that I can defend most of what I do to anyone who questions it.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

Within moments there was a massive police presence on the field. The police tried to separate the players, and when they didn't immediately comply, some of the officers deployed pepper spray - against student-athletes on national television. It wasn't a good look.</p>\n<p>I've never been a police officer, but I worked within the criminal justice system for seven years as a correctional officer, spending eight hours a day with convicted criminals so I have some understanding of the stress of the job. Not everyone is cut out to be a cop. If you are easily frightened, angered or slow to make important decisions, being a police officer is probably not the job for you. There is no shame in that. Unfortunately, the US court system is set up in a way that allows police to assert that they fear for the safety to justify just about any action up to murdering children holding play toys.</p>\n<p>Nationwide there is an issue with sub-standard police officers moving from one agency to another as they get fired for incompetence or misconduct. President Trump has promised to give police blanket immunity for crimes they commit, regardless of the circumstances.

I usually run about 40-50 myself. I&#39;ve tried\nseveral solutions to quickly find the tab I&#39;m looking for without much\nsuccess. Since installing <a\nhref=\"https://anybox.ltd/browser-deputy\">Browser Deputy,</a> I&#39;ve been\npleased with the way it incorporates into my workflow. I can summon the\napp with a hotkey and quickly find a tab, a bookmark or an item from my\nbrowser history, no matter what app I am in.</p>\n\n<p>Browser Deputy works with the following browsers:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Safari</li>\n<li>Chrome</li>\n<li>Edge</li>\n<li>Brave</li>\n<li>Firefox</li>\n<li>Vivaldi</li>\n<li>Opera</li>\n<li>Arc</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Aside from providing a quick search for browsers, Browser Deputy also\nlets you perform web searches with various built-in engines or custom\nones that you add yourself. I use <a\nhref=\"https://www.popsci.com/diy/how-to-remove-ai-google-search/\">a\ncustom Google search</a> that removes all the AI crud and provides the\ngood old ten blue links that we once took for granted. It was easy to\nadd to the list.</p>\n\n<p>The other useful feature in Browser Deputy is the ability to search menu\ncommands in whatever open app you happen to be in, not just browsers. It\ndoesn&#39;t give you a heads-up display of the commands like <a\nhref=\"https://sergii.tatarenkov.name/keyclu/support/\">KeyClu</a>, but it\nwill activate any command you search for.</p>\n\n<p>Browser Deputy is available for download from the <a\nhref=\"https://anybox.ltd/browser-deputy\">dev&#39;s website</a>.

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/47-2.webp\" alt=\"We_are_more\" /></p>\n<p>A few years ago, a man in his 60s here in NC, an amateur cyclist of some renown, won a race against a field of mostly younger riders. He was selected for a random drug test, which he failed. In his quest to remain competitive, the man, who was already legendary in the local racing community, a mentor to many and a man held in high esteem, resorted to cheating to increase his chances of winning a relatively meaningless bicycle race. In the process, he made the news, was banned from racing and severely damaged a hard-earned reputation. When I heard about it, I was livid. I didn't know the man. I knew of him. Some of my friends frequently made the one-hour trip to his hometown to train with him. Everyone called him The Old Man. My attempt to carry on a lifelong love affair with sports was already severely damaged by the steroid era in baseball. I adopted pro cycling as my new favorite, only to discover that almost every famous racer of the era was a cheat. It deeply affected me then and now.</p>\n<p>I took to social media to vent, as one does. I guy who knows me and The Old Man asked me a question that stuck with me about the whole situation. Is it fair to judge someone solely for the worst thing they have ever done? Is it? Society does it routinely in criminal justice cases. Sure, they take some mitigating circumstances into account, but if you mess up bad enough, you are going to prison despite your otherwise saintly life. I knew more than one person serving a life sentence when I worked in the correctional system who had but a single yet horrible conviction.</p>\n<p>In the army, a well-worn but true statement is that one “oh shit” wipes out one hundred “attaboys.” People remember Bill Buckner a lot more for making an error in the World Series than they do for his otherwise illustrious career. In my own tiny little personal Internet, one developer's failure to adequately address a mistake is still reverberating in our community months after the fact.</p>\n<p>I suspect that in moments of absolute honesty, most of us could make a confession that could potentially turn large swaths of our acquaintances against us. Maybe we bullied someone or we were needlessly unkind when we didn't have to be. Perhaps as ignorant and uninformed youngsters, we indulged in behavior that we are ashamed of now, like listening to Rush Limbaugh or voting for Reagan.</p>\n<p>I believe in extending grace to my fellow humans these days to the extent that I am able. I believe, as I said, that everyone has that one worst thing, and I try not to define people by that. If they are serial assholes, I let them go on their way, but in most cases, people aren't that way. I learned in 12-Step recovery that resentments against other people are the number one offenders in a person's life who is trying to stay sober. I was a miserable person with a whole pile of grievances 16 years ago. In the intervening time, I've worked hard to become forgiving, not for anyone's sake but my own. It's liberating and a heartily recommend it. You aren't letting your ex off the hook when you stop centering on your grievances, You are letting yourself off.</p>\n<p>I'm not one who preaches against being judgmental. Frankly, I think using your judgment is a survival skill, and it is impossible not to exercise it. You can't stick with the winners if you don't decide who they are. So judge away, but be careful what you do with your decisions. Don't write people off as a matter of course. Offer them a silent chance at redemption if you can. Put yourself in their shoes and treat them like you would want to be treated. In the long run, you will benefit. They will benefit, and we will be one step closer to a better world.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/40-1.webp\" alt=\"Mac VSPC\" /></p>\n<p>I don't want to stir up any trouble. I really don't. I am here to be as helpful as possible for people who are trying to make purchasing decisions about the technology they are going to acquire during this holiday season. Not only that, but I was perusing social media during lunch and lo and behold, I saw the decades old debate about the suitability of Apple computers and computers running Windows, raging on the same as ever. I thought folks were over this, but evidently, they are not.</p>\n<p>I started using personal computers in 1993. My first computer was an IBM 486 with Windows 3.1 installed. Over the next six years, I went from a novice to someone working in the support industry. The first time I received a call from a person who owned a Macintosh computer and wanted my assistance, I was incredulous. I couldn't believe that someone spent their money on something so expensive and so incompatible with everything with which I was familiar. In 2000, I was hired by a local school system, issued an Apple laptop, and immediately put to work servicing thousands of Apple computers across 21 schools. Within six months, my ability to configure and maintain Macs surpassed what I had learned in six years as a Windows user. Because I had to support both platforms, my knowledge of Windows and how to maintain it has never faltered. Although I haven't purchased a Windows machine for personal use in over a quarter of a century, I have been issued a few at work and touched literally thousands of them in my job.</p>\n<p>For a while, purchasing a Mac was a considerable investment when compared to obtaining an entry-level PC. I will admit to buying inexpensive Dell laptops for my daughters when they were in college. My mother, on the other hand, who is more financially secure, is the one person I recommended buying a Mac. The Dell PC she previously had during the early part of the 21st century was repeatedly infected with different forms of malware and hard for her to maintain. Since she entered the Apple ecosystem with an iPhone, an iMac, and an iPad, she's had very little problems, and like many users, has actually moved away from a desktop machine to using only handheld devices. Some tech snobs think that Apple locks you into their ecosystem by tying the devices together, but I can assure you that most regular people appreciate rather than resent that feature.</p>\n<p>These days, you can get an entry-level MacBook Air or a Mac Mini for under a thousand dollars, and the days of them being prohibitively expensive are over. Most people find that an entry-level PC purchased at Best Buy or Walmart will disintegrate within three or four years, whereas most Macs last up to a decade before they need to be replaced. Sometimes people that have never used anything but Windows will accuse Max of not being user-friendly, but the problem there lies with the user and not with the device. For 20 years, I watched five-year-old kindergarteners sit down at iMacs in a computer lab and begin to do things immediately. One little known fact is that low-end computers purchased in big box stores do not have the same components that other computers made by the same manufacturer enjoy. Period. There is definitely a trend towards awarding parts contracts to the lowest bidders, and certainly not to the ones who provide the most quality outside the gaming machines that some PC users purchase. Apple computers, on the other hand, enjoy the same quality components regardless of where they are sold.</p>\n<p>There are still people who believe that Macs are only good for graphic designers and creators. These same people believe that you must purchase a Windows machine to get real work done. I have news for them. I work at a small private university in the IT department. My job consists primarily of supporting Windows users and maintaining the computers on the university network. I use various Microsoft tools to do this. All of my IT related work is done on an iMac. If I need to use Windows, I simply log in via a virtual machine on the network to get access to the tools I need. The big graphics companies like Adobe have long made versions of their software for both Mac and PCs. Most of the time, outside specialized enterprise applications, users can get their work done regardless of the platform that they are on. Our university requires every student to purchase a computer, but we do not specify whether they must buy a Microsoft product or an Apple product.</p>\n<p>I am long past considering the type of computer one uses as criteria for evaluating their worthiness as a human being. It's just a machine. People who are fighting religious wars over computing platforms need to get a life. They are stuck in another decade. Having said that, I don't see a compelling reason to use Windows outside the specialty enterprise applications I mentioned earlier or just because one is familiar with the platform. I think a legitimate argument can be made for the superiority of Apple's operating systems and the apps that run on them by most knowledgeable people.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

It has built in sorting rules for 19 different types of files,\nincluding folders. These rules can be toggled on or off, but you cannot\nedit them. In addition, you can make your own very granular rules. The\nexample they give is representative of the power of the app. &quot;Move all\nfiles with the extension “DOCX” that contain the word “invoice” and were\nlast modified in the past year to a folder labeled “Invoices.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>What&#39;s remarkable is the speed at which Folder Tidy operates. It uses\nmacOS technology called Grand Central Dispatch to use all available\ncores to accomplish the tasks you assign it. In my case, it took about a\nsecond to sort and move directories with hundreds of different media\nfiles to subfolders on a different drive. I had to do some\ntroubleshooting after it failed to move all the files on the first try.\nIt turns out that my Spotlight database needed to be rebuilt, a problem\nI&#39;ve had before which also affects some search utilities, like Houdah\nSpot, that rely on it.</p>\n\n<p>Folder Tidy is not a replacement for Hazel. While it does what it sets\nout to do quickly and well, it is a file sorting utility that doesn&#39;t\nhave the depth of actions that Hazel does. If you already own Hazel,\nthere is no reason to add Folder Tidy. One other important thing to know\nis that Folder Tidy is a manual app. It doesn&#39;t watch folders and run\naction on the enclosed items automatically. </p>\n\n<p>I paid $2.49 for the app on Black Friday. It is ordinarily $9.99.</p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Folder Tidy - On Demand Fast Power' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/47-1.webp\" alt=\"Ethics\" /></p>\n<p>When I began to publish my writing online a year ago, I had no idea whether I would make it a habit or whether people would read anything I wrote. I hoped they would, but I had very little idea however all of this works. Blogging challenges were a mystery to me. My knowledge about how the whole community of personal bloggers from various platforms coalesces within social media circles was scant. The more I wrote and the more consistently I shared, the more learned about the unwritten expectations I would begin to place on myself. I also saw the constraints other people operated under, by choice, and how they differed from mine. Instinctively, I understood that being true to myself was the most important rule to follow. The other unwritten rules of blogging are just things I intuited along the way.</p>\n<p>To my delight, I learned that writing my own version of someone else's idea is totally fine, as long as I give them a shout-out for the inspiration. Having someone do the reverse for me is high praise. Any time I've written something and then been able to read someone else's experiences in the same set of circumstances, it's been enjoyable. I end up feeling a particular closeness to the writer. I like it best when there are other significant differences in our lives, so I can see that my feelings of being unique aren't particularly valid. People tend to be more alike than they are different, in my experience. I wrote a post on what it was like to attend 13 schools over a 12-year period, only to read accounts from an English-Canadian woman a couple of years older than me who had done something similar. I also discovered a fellow who lives a continent away who is similar to me in many other ways besides our schooling history. Taking inspiration from others writing is a way of relating in a more deep and connected way than social media could ever offer.</p>\n<p>Another ethical issue I and others have to deal with is the prevalence of AI writing tools and easily accessible they are. Things like grammar and spell checkers have been around for decades, but tools that can create an entire post from a mere prompt are new. I don't see myself letting some company's plagiarism machine create something that I would stick my name to. I don't have a problem having my spelling, grammar and punctuation checked by a computer because I'm used to that. Using a service that significantly changes my words, the tone and the structure just seems dishonest. There is a place for that in business, that being a cold and heartless environment. Blogging should have a soul. It should have a heart, and it should have an ethical code that the text you put under your byline is real and created by a human.</p>\n<p>On the honesty scale, I'd say I come in around 90% to 95% honest. Sometimes one has to stretch the truth a bit to protect the innocent or make a story worth telling. My style of writing is autobiographical. There are times when I just can't remember the exact order of events, where I was living or who I was married to (just kidding). I do the best I can. I aim to be entertaining and interesting, not to please a professional fact-checker. Of course, there are some things about which I always try to be scrupulously honest. When I write about sobriety and recovery, you can take it to the bank. If I convey a particularly funny story about something that happened while I was in the army, there may be a detail or two where I take a literary license. Most of military life is dull and boring, so if something sounds interesting, it's probably just in the way I'm writing it.</p>\n<p>I also tend to stick to just the facts when I write tech related posts. I want nothing more than to help someone find a real solution to a software issue. I'd feel horrible if I misled them about an app's suitability for a task, or if I wasn't diligent about pointing out a show stopping flaw. To the regular people in the world, a detailed explanation of menus, buttons, submenus and other user interface trivia is pure textual sleeping pills. For my fellow nerds and software geeks, it's vital information.</p>\n<p>At some point, my goal is to have more time to write more polished and detailed work, to spend more time fine-tuning what I put out there for folks to read. I want to work through more than one draft, like what I envision a real writer does, Meanwhile, I will continue to be a happy hack making stuff that's good enough to share even if it won't win any rewards.\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

I plan to spend the day in the company ot my kids, grandkids and my Mom. We will hang out, telling stories and snacking. Our one trip away from home is a planned excursion for lunch to get some pho from the very appropriately named Vietnamese Restaurant. That's its name.

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/thanksgiving.webp\" alt=\"thanksgiving\" /></p>\n<p>This year's Thanksgiving has a special flavor. My son, who lives far away in Austin, Texas, is here for a visit. I still live in the house where he grew up, and he enjoys these nostalgic returns. After we got home from the airport yesterday, he went for a run. He came home to report that he'd passed the homes of old friends, the middle school he attended, and various spots where he's committed various teenage sins in his wayward youth.</p>\n<p>A little later, we went to the train station to pick up his daughter, our granddaughter, who was traveling to meet us from Virginia, where she attends school. We all went out for a sushi feast before coming home to hang out, telling stories, and making each other laugh.</p>\n<p>I get up early, and as I sit here writing, I have that wonderful protective parental feeling that reminds me of my younger days when I'd wait for the kids to get up so I could make them breakfast and start the day. Later on, we will all be traveling across town to attend the annual family gathering at the remnants of my uncle's farm, where I lived during my high school years. My daughter and two of our other grandchildren will be there, along with other relatives ranging in age from nearly 80 down to a six-year-old.</p>\n<p>Luckily, no one will talk politics in mixed company. If the coast is clear, the progressive wing of the family may console each other under our breaths, but no one will be wearing a MAGA hat or thanking the Good Lord for the election of Donald Trump. We will be asked to give reports on anyone who is missing. One of the best parts of these rare family conclaves is the chance to catch up on family news.</p>\n<p>Wonder Woman is sitting across from me, already beginning our holiday shopping. With five children and 13 grandchildren, she has a lot of gifts to buy. I send her ideas and give her feedback, but all the real work, including wrapping the gifts when they get here, falls to her. My Black Friday shopping is relegated to taking advantage of software sales, a relatively selfish pursuit that I thoroughly enjoy. I probably won't be getting many new apps this year because, quite frankly, I have so many already that it's hard to even find things on sale that I don't already have installed!</p>\n<p>I make a gratitude list every day as part of my journaling practice. It helps me stay in tune with how fortunate I am in so many ways. Since last Thanksgiving, a lot has happened that has given me new reasons to be thankful. After a long pause, I started blogging again, giving myself a creative outlet that is enjoyable and therapeutic. I've enjoyed a marked resurgence in my interest in technology and married that to my writing to produce content that's been viewed over 400,000 times by people all around the world.</p>\n<p>If you are reading this, know that I appreciate you. Thanks for being interested in my world. Feel free to leave a comment or to reach out on social media. Have a happy Thanksgiving, whether you live in the US or not. Let's make a better world in the year ahead.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

President Lincoln created the holiday in 1863 in the midst of the American Civil War.</p>\n<p>My family's traditions are pretty normal. Wonder Woman and I alternate each year between her family and mine. Both families have all the expected Thanksgiving foods, turkey, dressing, cranberry sauce and various vegetables and deserts. No one person has to cook it all. We do it potluck style, where everyone attending brings a dish or two. The only slightly out of the ordinary offering is the occasional bushel of oysters we may have on hand, since we all live relatively close to the Atlantic coast.</p>\n<p>Doing a little research, I discovered there are some definitely strange customs followed by different people in the US.

You can use any type of input\ndevice, including your Mac&#39;s built-in microphone. MacWhisper can, if you\nchoose, replace the built-in dictation on your computer. Transcription\nis done on your device, not on a remote computer. The default output is\na .whisper file containing the original audio and the transcribed text,\nhowever it has numerous export choices:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>SRT and VTT subtitles</li>\n<li>CSV</li>\n<li>DOTE</li>\n<li>DOCX</li>\n<li>PDF</li>\n<li>Markdown</li>\n<li>HTML</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The transcription speed is remarkable, happening up to 30X over real\ntime using metal and GPU technology. Transcripts may be easily searched.\nFiller words (um, ah, etc.) are automatically removed. You can edit the\ntranscripts to correct spelling of names or other words.</p>\n\n<p>With the Pro version of the program, I get batch transcriptions of\nmultiple files. I can transcribe YouTube video and use my OpenAI key to\ntake advantage of Cloud Transcription and ChatGPT integration. I can\ntake advantage of translation services to convert text into other\nlanguages. It also adds a menu bar interface for global transcription\nand the ability to paste text into other apps.</p>\n\n<p>Students, non-profits and journalists always get 50% off the price by\ncontacting the developer. There is a free version of the app that lacks\nthe AI integration of the Pro version. It is available on <a\nhref=\"https://goodsnooze.gumroad.com/l/macwhisper\">Gumroad</a>.</p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=MacWhisper - Transcription Powerhouse' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

I get a good deal of comfort out of living in the same house for decades now. I was glad to keep the same job in the same building for 20 years before retiring. On the other hand, traveling and seeing new things is a special treat. My favorite part of my months-long honeymoon was sleeping in a different place every night. I like both things.</p>\n<p>In my job, most people are very unenthusiastic about having their computer updated, or god forbid, being issued a new one. When it comes to technology, the average person definitely prefers the familiar and comfortable over anything else. Not me. I'm always ready for new features, bug fixes, and extra security. Of course, since it's my profession, I'm more confident that I can fix any problems that pop up. Most of my career has been spent in education, where you would think people would be all about learning something new and expanding their horizons. You would be wrong if you thought that. Our ongoing controversy at work is around asking users to change the wireless network they use. That's it. Just select a different one from the list of what is available, type in your user name and password, and move on. Do I need to tell you how many meetings and conversations have already happened around this?</p>\n<p>Lots of decisions come down to something familiar vs. something new. Take going out to eat, for instance. Wonder Woman and I have a handful of tried-and-true locally owned restaurants which we frequent. When I see a new place featured in the newspaper, I immediately think of checking it out if it looks like something we'd fancy. We like international cuisine and we need gluten-free options. Yet, when it's the end of a long work day and we've decided that cooking is too much of a hassle, we almost always head to one of the places where we've been 100 times before. It's not called comfort food for nothing.</p>\n<p>I drive a 2005 Toyota Camry. It is a twenty-year-old hand-me-down from my mother, who literally drove it to church on Sundays. It has well over 200,000 miles. The paint is stained from being parked under an oak tree, and there are various scrapes and dents on every side of it. I've put exactly zero thought into getting a replacement for it. I haven't had a car payment since the Bush administration, and that thought horrifies me. I only drive it a couple of times a week to work and back anyway. Wonder Woman has a new Subaru Outback with all the bells and whistles, Apple Car Play, heated steering wheel, automatically adjusting mirrors and seats, a backup camera, the whole deal. I love to drive it and do so every chance I get.  It is indeed a balancing act.</p>\n<p>There are a few areas where I lean one way or another. I'm not much on rewatching movies or TV shows if I have already seen them, but I will re-read a book without hesitation. On my computer, I've used some of the same apps for many, many years, such as PathFinder (20 years), Evernote(15 years), and Launchbar(17 years) - all of which I ditched last year for replacements that I am now quite happy with. For other things, like email, I'm still using the same thing, the Gmail web interface that I have used since 2005.</p>\n<p>They say that without newness, memories don't get created, and life just sort of blends into a big blob. I believe that, so I do seek out new adventures. But I also relish in the comfort of the familiar. I expect most people are the same in that regard.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

I temper myself in public and on the Internet, mostly because my Mom reads my blogs and I care about offending her. But, when I am working on a troublesome computer or dealing with carrying my groceries across a rainy parking lot, swearing is in order. It's all kind of silly of course, deciding that one sound is OK but another sound is bad. I know a certain Kindergarten aged boy whose take home behavior chart recently had a big red X on it and a notation that he \"Said the F Word!!\" He probably won't do that again, not worth it I'm sure.</p>\n<p>As for movies, well society seems to have moved from not letting Lucy and Ricky Ricardo sleep in the same bed to an anything goes situation. In the first season of The Wire on HBO (AKA, the greatest TV show ever made), there is a scene that is just shy of four minutes long during which the F-Bomb is dropped 38 times by two actors. What a great play on words!</p>\n<p>One fact I learned while looking for links for this post - the director of Gone with the Wind paid a fine equivalent to $100,000 today just so Clark Gable could say, \"Frankly me dear, I don't give a damn.\" That is a commitment to art right there!</p>\n<p><a href='https://collider.com/gone-with-the-wind-first-curse-word-movie/'>The First Onscreen Curse Word Was in This Classic Movie</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/well-i-swear-a-brief-fing-history-of-profanity-in-the-movies-20140901-10axdu.html'>Well, I swear: A brief f---ing history of profanity in the movies</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/the-top-10-movies-with-the-most-swear-words/'>The top 10 movies with the most swear words</a>\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

Its simple menu lets you designate watched folders\nwhere you keep images accessed as part of your workflow, for instance\nscreenshots and downloads. You can view thumbnails of the images, the\nsize is customizable and get info on them which includes name, size,\ndimensions, creation date, tag, caption and modification date. Tags and\ncaptions can be added from with Clotski. The information presented can\nbe customized, and other metadata can be added if you wish. You can open\nthe image with your default app or choose from other compatible apps\nfrom an &quot;open with&quot; menu. When viewing the list of images in a folder\nyou can choose a list, grid or gallery view, and you can choose the sort\norder based on date or file size in ascending or descending order.</p>\n\n<p>One feature that is especially helpful is Clotski&#39;s ability to\nautomatically download any images you copy to the clipboard into a\nfolder you designate. You can set your own naming convention, as well as\nchoosing to save them in either jpg or png formats.</p>\n\n<p>For keyboard warriors, Clotski can be summoned with a custom shortcut,\nand it can be navigated without the use of a mouse. For further\norganization, Clotski lets you create collections of photos along with\ntags and folders. Collections can be accessed from a drop-down menu\nwithin the program If desired, you can designate an automatic tag to be\napplied to images you add to newly collected images. You can use the\ntags just with Clotski, or you can sync them with the Finder.</p>\n\n<p>While working with images in Clotski, you can copy or drag them into\ndocuments on which you are working. Clotski does not have any native\nediting functionality,</p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Clotski - A Clever Tool for Your Image Management Workflow' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/burning-bridge.webp\" alt=\"burning-bridge\" /></p>\n<p>Some of the best advice I ever received was an admonition against burning bridges. An old co-worker told me that when I was getting ready to leave a job at which I was unhappy. The immature side of me wanted to leave in a blaze of glory, letting everyone know what I thought of them and the place that employed them. Somehow I'd convinced myself that my opinion was important and that all those people needed my approval to be happy - none of which was actually true. You may have seen someone do exactly what I contemplated. It's always icky and transparent and never looks good.</p>\n<p>Sometimes people start burning their bridges when they are getting ready to leave a group as a way of self-protection. They don't want the separation to hurt so they begin to withdraw and cut off relationships. That's understandable. But I try to avoid doing it as best I can.  Sometimes in our lives a certain group dynamic only exists for a short while under a certain set of circumstances that can never be recaptured - political campaigns, social movements, even some educational opportunities are like that. Just because the magic of the moment is gone doesn't mean that the people involved in it are no longer valuable, not because of what they can do for you, but just because people and relationships have an intangible worth that we honor when we continue to respect them.</p>\n<p>In the current political environment in the US, I am very much of the mind to avoid people who like and support the president-elect. Their values and mine are obviously tremendously different. At a fundamental level, I just don't understand what makes them tick, nor do I have a desire to. But, I'm not seeking out every conservative I know to let them know that Lou Plummer thinks they are a bad person. There are ways to avoid people without purposefully alienating them. This in no way means that I'll silently nod my head when someone begins to spout off about how wonderful DT is, it just means that I don't feel the need to tell anyone off preemptively.</p>\n<p>When someone decides that ending a relationship with me on a negative note is the thing to do, it makes me wonder what they hope to gain. It doesn't happen very often, and usually when it does, it's part of a mass casualty event when a disgruntled co-worker exits, but occasionally it's personal. It reeks of immaturity and poor judgement. I do the best I can not to take it personally. Some people are just built that way, I suppose. In reality, telling someone off, getting the last word, and making a dramatic exit only kind of feel good and only in the moment. That action is usually followed by a big let down and moments of self-doubt.</p>\n<p>It's like my Mama (and probably yours too) used to say. If you don't have anything good to say, don't say anything. It’s not trite. It's true in most contexts. Exceptions can be made for calling out injustice and bigotry. <BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

Twitter is having it's second mass exodus. The first happened when Elon Musk purchased the network in 2022. The most recent is a result of the 2024 US election. The primary beneficiary appears to be Bluesky. Mark Zuckerberg is being mocked for rapidly making changes to Meta's Threads to copy the things people like about other networks. Even Instagram is now allowing users to reset the algorithm so they can see more from people they follow and less of what Meta wants them to see.</p>\n<p>Over the years there have been many social networks come and go. They promise to be the next big thing  but they end up falling to the wayside when they end up not being able to compete with the behemoths. Let's hope the underdogs make it this time. I'm heavily invested in Mastodon and I am beginning to also spend time on Bluesky. I want them to last.</p>\n<p>Here are a few of the late, great attempts to catch on that tried and failed or were just superseded.</p>\n<p><a href='https://em360tech.com/tech-article/what-happened-to-myspace'>What Happened to Myspace?

Then I retired and was at a loss. I read a lot of books and watched a bunch of movies, but it wasn't what I'd call really fun. Instead, it felt like I was just doing things to occupy my time. Eventually, I just went back to work. That was a pretty good solution, but not a perfect one. I still think about not having to work a lot, but I think the next time I get that opportunity, it will be different.</p>\n<p>My fantasy retirement includes plenty of time for writing. Over the past year, I have made blogging a priority by default. It's something I enjoy. I do it every day, and I can just imagine having the time to fully develop ideas, do research, and polish my posts instead of the rush jobs I'm knocking out now. I'd like to have a nice office space at home with decent speakers to play music on, a really comfortable office chair with all my tried-and-true computer essentials right there at my fingertips. I don't currently use my office space because it's not where Wonder Woman hangs out. When we are at home together, we like to be together.</p>\n<p>I'm so conscious of my limited free time right now that I don't like to use any of it to do anything except exactly what I want to do, with a few limits. I imagine myself with more time, being more willing to get a walking routine established with just the right mix of music playlists and downloaded podcasts like I did before my mobility was limited by knee surgery. I would not be forced into early pre-dawn walks like I am now.</p>\n<p>Since I'm a couple of years older than Wonder Woman, part of my fantasy retirement will be spent at home while she is still working. I will be able to use my time to do some of the chores, like grocery shopping, that we now do together on the weekends. I'm not going too far out on a limb by claiming that I will be Molly Maid or anything because that ain't happening. The cleaning and lawn services we've had over the past few years have been among the best investments we've ever made, and I am way too used to them to think about moving backward and taking that stuff back over myself.</p>\n<p>A few years ago, I looked into volunteering at a few places using the skill set I have in technology. I didn't find anything that was a good fit around my work hours, but I'd be willing to look into that once more while having a much more flexible schedule. We have one of the best military history museums in the world in my hometown, but it's mostly staffed by retired guys from the 82nd Airborne and Special Forces. My half-communist ass would probably not fit in well there, although you never know. I have some retired military friends who are just as radical as I imagine myself to be.</p>\n<p>The primary benefit of not having to go to work is that I'll no longer have to do customer relations. I'm not the biggest people person. Although I don't have any problems with getting along with folks at work 99% of the time, that remaining 1% is a giant PIA that sucks the joy out of too many days. When I never have to crawl under another desk to plug something in for another adult, I will truly be a happy man.</p>\n<p>For the time being, however, I'm going to keep punching the clock and just enjoy knowing that, if push comes to shove, I can make my way towards the exit. I'll enjoy the 99% of the job that isn't aggravating and be extra grateful that I get to ride back and forth (and eat lunch!) with the love of my life.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

They are  the big three\nin Microsoft Office, the menu bar manager, Bartender and the window\nmanager, Magnet.</p>\n\n<p>The vendor with the most apps on the list is surprisingly, Microsoft\nwith five.</p>\n\n<p>For it&#39; market share to be as small as it, Firefox must have a higher\nproportion of Mac users employing it than PC users.</p>\n\n<p>I would wager that VLC&#39;s popularity is due to its longevity and because\nof enterprise deployments. I know I have been putting it on images in\nthe educational space for as long as I can remember. IINA seems more\npopular with more knowledgeable users,</p>\n\n<p>Despite all the predictions made about Bartender&#39;s future after the\nbotched handling of its sale, it is the most downloaded paid app in the\necosystem after Microsoft Office.</p>\n\n<p>I have never been a big user of window management tools, and I had no\nidea Magnet was as popular as it is. It has 165,000 reviews in the App\nStore and a 4.9 rating.</p>\n\n<p>I find it interesting that the top 25 apps did not include a single\nnotes app, automation tool or clipboard manager. The only messaging app\nis Microsoft Teams, and I hesitate to say that is its primary function.</p>\n\n<p>The presence of the six-year-old Android File Transfer app is\nmind-blowing. I suspect this indicates that the download figures are\nworldwide and include countries where Androids have huge market share.</p>\n\n<p>The high ranking of App Cleaner is good for two reasons - it\ndemonstrates that an app doesn&#39;t have to be updated constantly to be\nuseful (last update was 2023-07-05). It also shows that lots of people\nbelieve in doing more than just dragging unwanted apps to the trash.</p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=The Top 25 Most Downloaded Mac Apps' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

In World War Two, Japanese soldiers committed mass suicide in battle after battle rather than surrendering or being beaten.  I am reminded of a scene from the Will Ferrell comedy, <em>Talladega Nights</em>, after Ricky Bobby's sons brag of throwing their grandfather's war medals over a bridge and disrespecting a teacher, their dad exclaims \"My boys are winners and winners get to do whatever they want.\" It's obvious that a lot of people share that sentiment.</p>\n<p>Athletic contests by design have a winner and a loser at the end of the competition, but who is going to call Aaron Judge of the NY Yankees, a man whose salary is twice that of the entire Detroit Tigers, a loser?  Are the athletes who go to the Olympic games and don't win a medal losers? Maybe they use that definition on their own minds as motivation, I don't know. I've only been around a couple of Olympians and I didn't ask them. I just know that from my own athletic career, I felt like a winner every time I gave the competition everything I had. What more could I do?</p>\n<p>I've never been as opposed to anything in my life as I was against the Us war with Iraq. I opposed it with everything I had. When Obama, who unlike other prominent Democrats, had never supported the war, was elected, I felt like the antiwar movement had won. So did a lot of other folks. Most coalitions closed up shop as we waited for the troops to come home. Only it took years for the last soldier to leave Iraq (2011). When Obama left office in 2017, there were still American soldiers in Afghanistan for reasons no one could really explain.</p>\n<p>There are people who turn just about everything into a competition to satisfy some need they have to be better than other people. I've known too many dentists and ad execs who, in their minds, turn into Tour de France riders on a Saturday morning bicycle ride at the club ride. Putting other people in danger and disrupting the flow of the entire undertaking is entirely acceptable in their minds if they can beat a bunch of school teachers and retirees to the next stop sign. Even on something as neutral as the Appalachian Trail, there were those people who bragged at camp sites about how many miles they'd covered and how fast they'd hiked. No one cared.</p>\n<p>It's funny how these competitive types never try to win the competition on the job to close the most tickets or help the most customers. I wonder why.</p>\n<p>After the recent election, a lot of people feel like they are on the winning side, but I have news for them. Unless they are in the 1%, they are going to come out of the next four years on the losing end. The educational system is going to suffer, and that hurts everyone.  Unmitigated climate change will accelerate, and that hurts everyone. Pollution will increase. Government services will be deprecated. We will all live in a less functional country. All of that Trump-style winning is going to help one fat guy with a bad combover and too much makeup.</p>\n<p>Winners are happy people. Winners are those amongst us who live in peace. They don't have the biggest houses or the nicest cars. What they have is appreciation for what they've got and an absence of longing for what they don't. They enjoy what they enjoy without a need to beat someone else. I like winners like that.\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

An app has to be super useful and be\nsomething I use frequently to remain visible at all times. The latest\naddition by Sindre Sorhus, Supercharge is an instant add. It has a great\nmany uses and has replaced other utilities that have narrower focus.\nMore tools are being added regularly, so if you have this app, make sure\nto install updates as soon as they are released to get new features. I\nwon&#39;t cover them all, just the ones I use personally.</p>\n\n<h2>From the Menu Bar</h2>\n\n<p>The menu bar icon presents the following option in a drop-down:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Hide all windows</li>\n<li>Show Desktop</li>\n<li>Quit All Apps</li>\n<li>Hide My Email (opens this buried item in System Settings)</li>\n<li>Private Relay opens this buried item in System Settings)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Tweaks</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Unminimize windows when app becomes active</li>\n<li>Dim icons of hidden apps in the dock</li>\n<li>Create new text file with Option+N</li>\n<li>Open new files after naming</li>\n<li>Auto-adjust column widths in Finder</li>\n<li>Quit an app when closing its last Window (I don't usually like to mimic Micro$oft behavior, but I like this feature)</li>\n<li>When clicking on an active icon in the dock, hide app</li>\n<li>Add to Finder's context menu<ul>\n<li>Copy path</li>\n<li>Copy file name</li>\n<li>Image dimensions</li>\n<li>Make symlink</li>\n<li>Move to...</li>\n<li>Copy to...</li>\n<li>Open in Terminal (for folders)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p></li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p>The ability to make those modifications in the Finder makes it much more\npowerful.</p>\n\n<h2>Shortcuts</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Toggle desktop widgets</li>\n<li>Open Passwords from menu bar</li>\n<li>Hide all windows</li>\n<li>Quit all apps (except menu bar apps)</li>\n<li>Show desktop</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I was using the beta feature to close visible notifications which\ndefinitely had a beta feel to it, until I discovered that Better Touch\nTool&#39;s implementation of this feature closes not just visible\nnotifications, but all existing ones. I&#39;m sure Sindre will get this\nworking similarly in future releases.</p>\n\n<h2>Tools</h2>\n\n<p>I work on an MBA at home and an iMac for work. For apps that don&#39;t have\niCloud sync, using the export and import settings tool has been\nextremely useful and has saved me a ton of time. It&#39;s also useful when I\nwant to experiment with how an app is set up, allowing me to revert\nsettings if I don&#39;t like what I get after changing things around.</p>\n\n<p>You can get a fully functional copy of the app <a\nhref=\"https://sindresorhus.com/supercharge\">here</a>. The only\nlimitation is a reminder to buy the app every 12 hours, and no automatic\nupdates. All data and settings carry over if you buy it.</p>\n\n<p>I suggest you just go ahead and buy the app. If there was ever an\nInstabuy, this is it.</p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Using Supercharge' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/family-1.webp\" alt=\"Family\" /></p>\n<p>This might be rough for some. Not everyone had a happy childhood. Mine certainly had its rough spots, but for the most part, we had a lot of opportunities for pure joy too. So, in no particular order, here is a hit parade from the 70s.</p>\n<p><strong>Music</strong> - My mom and stepfather had a record player that stayed busy. I grew up listening to music that I still play today. We had all the Beatles albums. James Taylor got a lot of airtime. Especially for us kids, we got to listen to Pete Seeger sing <em>Little Boxes</em> and <em>Abi-Yoyo</em>. I even remember my stepfather playing a particular Arlo Guthrie record with <em>Alice's Restaurant</em>. My own dad was partial to Neil Diamond, so I get feelings for him whenever I hear one of the familiar songs.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong> - My mom didn't always cook breakfast, but more often than not, we didn't have to resort to cereal. Being in the South meant that bacon, eggs, and grits were a staple, although she had an actual waffle iron, so we got that sometimes. Pancakes and oatmeal were also on offer. When we did get cereal, there was always a controversy over whose turn it was to get the prize in the bottom of the box. I wasn't really fond of the \"eat everything on your plate\" rule that my stepfather imposed because Mom insisted on regularly serving English peas, which I despise to this day. I did learn how to enjoy asparagus though.</p>\n<p><strong>Travel</strong> - We weren't that well off, but we managed to have plenty of opportunities to visit parks and beaches when we happened to be living in the eastern part of the state. We moved a lot. When I grew up, I took my kids to some of the same places I'd been able to go to as a kid. One problem with travel was the size of the cars my parents had. Imagine five people in a Ford Pinto on a late-night trip up Interstate 95 from central NC to Washington, DC. That one was partially a business trip. My stepfather, a journalist, got to attend a press conference with other NC reporters to grill President Ford.</p>\n<p><strong>Holidays</strong> - Despite the lack of funds, we were never disappointed at Christmas. We got all the regular stuff kids get: bikes that lasted for years, baseball gloves, and always books about whatever we happened to be interested in at the time. We usually traveled to see family too. To my mother's everlasting credit, even though she and my dad got divorced around the time I started school, she has stayed in contact with his family to this very day. My dad lived out of state, but we still got to see our grandparents, our aunt, and our uncles.</p>\n<p><strong>Freedom</strong> - In the time before cell phones and excessive protectiveness, we had the license to roam. I was a hustler as a kid, always on the lookout to make a few bucks, and I rode my bike far and wide looking for soda bottles to sell back to the store. I walked the roads looking for aluminum cans. My mom willingly took me to the salvage yard to cash those in. We always had permission to go to the library when we lived someplace where it was close enough to get to. Some summers I practically lived there. Lots of times we lived in apartments with pools, and when we didn’t, we joined a co-op pool, which I didn't realize until I was an adult was whites only. I was born the year the civil rights act was signed, but there were still vestiges of segregation around if you looked.</p>\n<p><strong>TV and Movies</strong> - We had the same 19-inch TV my entire childhood. In the afternoons, we'd watch black and white re-runs of <em>The Beverly Hillbillies, The Andy Griffith Show, and Gomer Pyle.</em> Some of our favorite nighttime shows were <em>Happy Days</em> and * Laverne and Shirley.* One little town we lived in had a main street movie theater with one-dollar tickets. We could just about see the place from our house, and we got to go there whenever anything appropriate was playing. We still make fun of my sister for leaving <em>Pippi Longstocking</em> early because she got scared.</p>\n<p>What was best about all of that was that it took place in an environment of my mother's love and commitment to give us the best childhood she could. She 100% succeeded, and I am so very grateful to this day.\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

There&#39;s not much you can throw at it that it\ncan&#39;t handle, including old files from StuffIt and DiskDoubler. It can\neven extract files from some Windows .exe installers. The problem with\nThe UnArchiver is that it does decompression only. If you want to make\nyour own archives, you need another program. Natively, macOS can create\nZIP and DMG files but that&#39;s it.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://macitbetter.com/\">BetterZip 5 from macitbetter i</a>s a\nmuch more full-featured app, although it isn&#39;t free. It&#39;s $24.95 for use\non up to five Macs for personal users. It is also available on Setapp.\nBetter Zip has some pretty cool superpowers:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Quicklook extension for viewing files inside archives without opening them</li>\n<li>Edit archived files in an external application, and BetterZip can save the changes back and update your archive.</li>\n<li>Open and extract winmail.dat files.</li>\n<li>Open, extract, and modify ePub files.</li>\n<li>Extract images and sounds from PDFs</li>\n<li>AES-256 Encryption, password manager, password generator</li>\n<li>Finder Integration and share menu</li>\n<li>Filtering - only extract certain files from archives</li>\n<li>Integration with Alfred and Hazel</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Keka is a perennial favorite of many Mac users. It has a free version on\n<a href=\"https://www.keka.io/en/\">the developer&#39;s website</a>and a $5\nversion on the <a\nhref=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/keka/id470158793?mt=12\">Mac App\nStore.</a> Keka has compression and decompression tools. Keka can divide\nlarge files into multiple parts that will automatically reassemble after\ndecompression. You gain the ability to use 256-bit encryption. You can\nalso take advantage of a drag and drop interface into the Keka main\nwindow, or by simply dropping files onto the Keka icon in the dock.</p>\n\n<p>For those who want scripting and a CLI as well as a GUI, <a\nhref=\"https://peazip.github.io/\">Peazip</a> is probably the best bet. A\nfree app, it also has the widest array of security features.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Offers two-factor authentication</li>\n<li>Opens 200 types of compressed files in the GUI</li>\n<li>Multiple file management features: convert archives, search in archives, bookmarks, tabbed browsing,</li>\n<li>Portable - can be run from a USB or other external drive</li>\n<li>Open Source</li>\n<li>Cross platform (Linus, macOS Windows)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Some Finder alternatives offer compression and decompression, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://commander-one.com/\">Commander One</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/pathfinder-by-cocoatech\">PathFinder</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/qspace\">Qspace</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Mac Compression Utilities' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/ago_downloaded.webp\" alt=\"Bible Belt\" /></p>\n<p>For a good part of my life, I tried to be religious and failed miserably. During my formative years, church was a social connection as well as a place for religious instruction. During elementary school, my Mom was married to a non-believer, so she didn't attend church, but my siblings and I went with a neighbor to a Southern Baptist church on the outskirts near the prison. My brother and I were active in the boys’ youth group, called RAs for Royal Adventurers. In the summer, we went to VBS (Vacation Bible School).</p>\n<p>In high school, I lived with my aunt and uncle. They went to a Presbyterian Church, one of many in the area, reflecting the Scottish heritage in the part of North Carolina where we lived. One of my favorite parts of each week was the Sunday evening Youth Fellowship meetings. It was the one place where kids from the different high schools in the area hung out together. We had a church league softball team that was a lot of fun. Our yearly beach trip was something I looked forward to immensely. I got a lot of love there in spite of getting caught smoking weed by the youth minister. I wasn't a well-behaved kid, but I was still welcome.</p>\n<p>As an adult, I have attended Baptist, Presbyterian, and Seventh-day Adventist churches. I've been baptized at least twice. I may have also been baptized as a baby since during the brief time my parents were married to each other, they attended the Methodist church, which practices infant baptism. All three of my children attended private, church-affiliated schools for part of their K-12 lives.</p>\n<p>Both my sister and my father are ordained ministers in the United Methodist Church. It was a second career for both of them. In retirement, Dad no longer worships at a Methodist church because it has grown too liberal for him. My mother has done medical missionary work in Rwanda. She is a member of an Anglican church that is affiliated with the Rwandan version of that denomination. She was a member of an Episcopalian church for a long time, but when her congregation split after the ordination of Gene Robinson, an openly gay bishop, she went with her husband and the other conservatives to form a new congregation. My sister has many of the same political beliefs that I hold, and she is one of the few people I feel comfortable talking to when it comes to issues of faith.</p>\n<p>Despite all that churching, I ended up a non-believer. I tried as hard as I knew how to find a connection with a supernatural God, but I never felt anything, not ever. As a recovering alcoholic from the 12-Step tradition, which relies heavily on the concept of a \"higher power,\" I had to do considerable mental gymnastics to finally get sober. I finally resolved to use my AA group as a power greater than myself. Collectively, that is 100% true, and it was only after I stopped fighting against what I felt was an inappropriate religious influence that I was able to stop drinking for good, or at least for the last 16 years.</p>\n<p>Aside from the lack of an emotional connection with religion, my other reasons for the position I hold are much the same as many other non-believers. I can't reconcile things like the Holocaust and childhood leukemia with a loving and caring God. The historical reality of how the Bible became canon is more than a little sus to me as well. I really like quite a few parts of it anyway, especially The Sermon on the Mount, which is as good an outlook on a righteous life as I have seen anywhere. I am also disgusted to the very core of who I am as a person with right-wing-influenced Christianity. People who talk Jesus out of one side of their mouth and cut nutrition programs for the poor out of the other side are contemptible, and I want as little to do with them as possible. When I think of the average white conservative Christian, I think of the ways they advocate for things like discrimination against LGBT people, their support for the death penalty, and their attempts to force their beliefs into the political fabric of a country that was founded on religious freedom. I like Christians like Jimmy Carter and Martin Luther King, Jr. I do not like Christians like James Dobson and Tony Perkins. I think they are evil people.\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

Various apps like <a\nhref=\"https://obsidian.md/\">Obsidian</a> and <a\nhref=\"https://bear.app/\">Bear</a> use Markdown by default. There is a\nwhole ecosystem of tools around the easy-to-use language where you use\nvarious keyboard elements to create styles that can be interpreted by\nbrowsers and other apps. Markdown lets you add:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Bold</li>\n<li>Italic</li>\n<li>Quotes</li>\n<li>Lists (numbered, bullets, and checklists)</li>\n<li>Links (to web pages and images)</li>\n<li>Code blocks</li>\n<li>Headers</li>\n<li>Tables</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are different flavors of Markdown, but the most commonly used one\nis referred to as GitHub-flavored Markdown. As a blogger, I prefer to\nwrite in Markdown to format my posts for the web. The free app, <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/MarkEdit-app/MarkEdit\">MarkEdit</a> uses 100%\npure GitHub Markdown. Out of the box. The interface is pretty bare\nbones, but you can customize the toolbar to use the various tools on\nselected text. MarkEdit permits the insertion of multiple carats, so you\ncan highlight disconnected blocks of text. MarkEdit is intended to be a\nminimalist writing tool. It has a good feature set. There isn&#39;t any\nbloat. There are plenty of other editors that have preview, different\nflavors of Markdown and more. It&#39;s just a matter of taste and what your\nneeds are. </p>\n\n<p>The latest version incorporates Apple&#39;s writing tools, allowing you to\nuse proofreading and AI rewriting tools to change your text. Although I\nam not personally a fan of AI-generated content, there probably isn’t\nany harm in letting it make a business email more professional if need\nbe.</p>\n\n<p>MarkEdit does not contain a viewer to show your text with the formatting\nenforced.

I do have my moments where I dare to contemplate what's going to happen. I don't always have a rosy view. Like a lot of people, the recent presidential election shook me to my core. The realization of a  lot of my worst fears is already in motion as our new government takes shape. From a purely personal perspective, here in old white guy land, things are just grand. The future of Lou is pretty rosy, but I will be damned before I let that selfish perspective be the lens through which I view the world.</p>\n<p>As bad as things look, there is one overriding truth. Throughout the history of mankind, things have always gotten better. Sometimes the pace has been excruciatingly slow. At other times, progress has been made at breathtaking speed. I look at things like HIV research. We've gone from an epidemic illness being a death sentence to it becoming just another treatable illness in one generation. We went from the first airplane to landing on the moon in a single lifetime. Mankind is badass like that.</p>\n<p>When I talk to friends having a rough time, I like to remind them that every bad thing that has ever happened to them in the whole entire life hasn't killed them. Whatever they happen to be going through at the moment, whether it be a lost job, a divorce, or something else, isn't likely to kill them either. Sometimes in life, you lose battle after battle only to win the war. During the civil rights movement, the people of Birmingham had police dogs turned on them and were sprayed with fire hoses as police chief Bull Connor dealt violently with nonviolent protesters. John Lewis had his skull fractured for marching across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama. The very next year, the Civil Rights Act was passed. Bull Connor lost, and John Lewis won.</p>\n<p>Life is a series of peaks and valleys. When we are down in the valley like we are right now, it's hard to remember what the mountain tops were like. It's a lot easier to be pessimistic than it is to be positive. People of faith have heaven to look forward to, but secular people just have their one wild and precious life. I'll not let anyone take away the things in this life that give it meaning. I will continue to be a loud and proud progressive. I will hold on to the values I have until I find a better alternative. There are plenty of people like me. The conservatives have won two majorities over a period of 32 years. Their current hold on power is temporary, and unless we move into a total dictatorship, and I realize there is a chance of that, we will have weapons of democracy to use.</p>\n<p>The challenges we face are real. Climate change, competition for resources, rising authoritarianism, oppression of vulnerable minorities - all of these things are real. We will experience setbacks in combating them, but we will win in the end. We always do.\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

There are some apps that let you increase\nthat number, but not by much. At most, you&#39;ll have a couple of days work\nto refer back to. The app, <a\nhref=\"https://recentsapp.com/\">Recents</a>, will trace you work back by\nmonths in some cases.</p>\n\n<p>Recents breaks your workflow down on a per-app basis and provides the\nmost recently used documents for each one, even if the app itself\ndoesn&#39;t have a recent files menu. For example, I use Rapidmg to open\ndisk images. The program normally opens the disk image, moves the\ncontents to my Applications folder, and then dismounts and closes\nwithout any intervention from me. There is no menu. Using Recents, I can\nsee a list of the last 15 DMGs I&#39;ve opened, and reopen them at will.</p>\n\n<p>Recents works with a wide variety of apps and file types. In the\nadmittedly confusing file structure we use at work, I often can&#39;t\nremember the exact path of saved documents, but I know the app I created\nit with. Using Recents, I can easily find and open what I am looking for\nin a centralized location. Some of the apps with which I use Recents\nare:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Microsoft Office</li>\n<li>Console</li>\n<li>Preview</li>\n<li>PDF Expert</li>\n<li>VLC</li>\n<li>Obsidian (opens vaults, not documents)</li>\n<li>Motrix</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The app has a light and dark mode and can be set to mimic your system\npreferences. Recents can be access three ways:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>From the dock</li>\n<li>From the menu bar</li>\n<li>Hidden and summoned from a hot key</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Recents can be downloaded from <a href=\"https://recentsapp.com/\">the\ndevelopers website</a>.

The day marks the end of Transgender Awareness Week, which is used to raise public knowledge about the transgender community and the issues they face</strong></p>\n<p>The first trans guy I ever met was an anti-war activist from North Carolina. It wasn't a big deal to me. At the time, all I wanted were allies against the Bush administration'd policies and Aiden was just such a person. That was almost 20 years ago. We are still friends on Facebook to this day, although I have not see him for years. I didn't get into activism until I was nearly 40 and I had no idea how things work on the left. We get criticized often for going off topic. People talk about Palestine at the wrong time or they bring up Trans rights in the wrong places. I here to tell you, Trans rights are human rights and there isn't a wrong time to be an advocate for human rights, especially these days. The Republicans can't get us cheaper eggs so they are keeping their hate filled agenda going by tapping into the anti-trans sentiment they have ginned up.</p>\n<p>Even if you've never knowingly met a trans man or woman, you still have room in your life to be an ally and an advocate. Don't let people denigrate them in your presence and let others know how you feel about respecting human rights - all human rights. Make a donation to the Trevor project. Post something on social media. Write a letter to the editor about what a terrible person some trans-hating politician is. Speak up. Be visible.

Just about anything can be funny if you frame it the right way. It sometimes shocks people who don't know me that well, but anyone who has to suffer through working with me gets used to it rather quickly. I lean towards dry and acerbic humor because that's pretty much the way I perceive the world. There are an awful lot of absurd things about being alive, and pointing them out to people gives me purpose. I can't stand it when there is an obvious joke waiting to be made and yet no one will say anything because \"inappropriate.\" No! Someone needs to get that laugh. It might as well be me.</p>\n<p>I went through a stage when I downloaded routines of some of the most famous comics who have ever lived to listen to when I was spending a lot of time in my car for work. Being funny on demand didn't seem easy, but it didn't seem that hard either. I thought about writing some jokes and going to an open mic night at a comedy club, but I never followed through. For one thing, me and bars don't mix well, and I also might have been a little bit chicken. It was still fun listening to Richard Pryor, Lenny Bruce, Bill Hicks and even Bill Cosby. This was before he went to prison for being a predator.</p>\n<p>I think Richard Pryor is probably the funniest human who ever lived. His humor is timeless because it's about the human condition. A lot of comedians do topical comedy, which is funny at the moment, but it doesn't age well. My daughter thought me and her mother were so weird because we went on and on about how funny the show <em>In Living Color</em> was. She finally found it on DVD and watched a few episodes. It was full of jokes about Barbara Bush and Mike Tyson and other people who just weren't part of her world. She was very disappointed and hasn't asked me for entertainment options in a very long time.</p>\n<p>I try not to be think-skinned when listening to stand-up. I'm more than willing to grant artistic license to a performer, but there are still some lines that don't need to be crossed. I don't like anti-trans humor. If you were to substitute some other marginalized group for tans folks into some of those jokes, people would look at you like you were wearing a Klan robe. I get that not everyone  \"gets\" the struggle of that community, but making jokes at their expense is getting old. Even otherwise perceptive people like Dave Chappelle and Ricky Gervais fall into the not-funny category when it comes to that brand of humor.</p>\n<p>I love using humor as a weapon when I don't have anything else to offer. Any time someone tries to defend the indefensible to me, I laugh at them. You want to defend Trump? You're funny because he's a clown, and you're one too if you're defending him. Not only that, but you want to tell me why the death penalty or cutting school lunch programs are good ideas? I'm going to laugh right in your face. How can you seriously feel that way and call yourself a human being?  Maybe that's disrespectful. Ok, it is disrespectful, but I don't really care. Laughing at you is better than fighting with you, which I don't care to do.</p>\n<p>Feel free to send me jokes.\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

Unless you can&#39;t. Then you\nhave a problem. Or, maybe you are experimenting with <a\nhref=\"https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/open-core-legacy-patcher\">Open\nCore Legacy Patcher</a> to install a later version of macOS on a device\nthat doesn&#39;t officially support it. In that case, you are going to need\na copy of an OS, preferably bootable, and some sort of media to copy\nthat OS installation onto. You can do the installation through other\nmethods, like target disk mode or various imaging applications too, but\nthey take some know how. The other thing you can use these files for is\nwhen experimenting with virtual machines in something like Virtual Box,\nUTM or VMWare Fusion.</p>\n\n<h2>Mist</h2>\n\n<p>To get a copy of the firmware and OS you need, I know of no easier\nmethod than using <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/ninxsoft/Mist?tab=readme-ov-file\">Mist</a>, a\nfree app available on GitHub. With Mist, you can get everything from the\nlatest beta, all the way back to Mac OS X 7.5. You can get Intel or\nApple Silicon installers, or the universal installers available for\nmacOS Big Sur and later.</p>\n\n<h2>Balena Etcher</h2>\n\n<p>If you are planning to use an SD card or a USB drive, things work better\nwhen you flash the media than when you try to fiddle with partitions and\npermissions on your own from the command line. Luckily, there is an app\nfor that. It is <a href=\"https://etcher.balena.io/\">Balena Etcher</a>, a\nfree app with built-in safeguards to keep you from erasing the wrong\ndrive. Balena Etcher will also create bootable media for Windows and\nvarious Linux builds too.</p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Two Free Apps for Mac OS Installation Ease' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/linkage/images-4.webp\" alt=\"images\" /></p>\n<p>I am not one of those priggish tee-totalers who thinks drinking is a sin and that no one should indulge in demon rum, not at all. In fact, coming from a 12-Step recovery tradition, I have no real opinion on drinking as an institution, but I've never looked down my nose at anyone who enjoys a cold beer, a glass of win or a mixed drink. I don't look down my nose at people who have a problem with booze either. Nobody volunteers to become an alcoholic. Alcohol just has a way of taking over the lives of a certain percentage of the population, usually ones who have family members with the same issue. There are certain genetic markers for addiction and whether it's an illness isn't really debatable anymore except by science denying morons - so about half of America.LOL.Sob.</p>\n<p>I digress. My point is, if you have decided not to drink for a night or for the rest of your life, whatever, here are a few things I have learned. Number one - it's less of a big deal to other people than you think it is. When people who like to drink are kinda sorta thinking about stopping, they almost always cite the social pressure to drink as a reason why they can't. That's their inner little drunk devil talking to them. Nobody cares! They aren't thinking about you as much as you think they are.</p>\n<p>When you are at a party or a family holiday celebration, get a non-alcoholic drink and hold on to that sucker for dear life. DO NOT PUT IT DOWN! If you're trying to camouflage your sobriety, put a twist and a swizzle stick in you club soda. Just don't let go of it. I've had a couple of occasions where I've failed to obey this rule and ended up with a horrifying mouth full my step-father's gin and my sister's wine. Not cool. I didn't relapse or anything, but it's not a good feeling. Once my sister-in-law spilled a glass of wine on me and I had  two-hour drive home. I used Vick's Medicated Rub in my nostrils to kill the smell just like people at the morgue do to cover up the smell of decaying flesh.</p>\n<p>You can also plan on arriving late and leaving early to any parties when you are trying to live that sober life. Drinking mocktails or alcohol free beer is an option for some but personally I never wanted the romance of booze without the booze. If you get a craving for alcohol, eating sweets is a well known way to make the craving subside. Trust me.</p>\n<p>If you've decided you do have a problem and you want to quit for good, and brothers and sisters, I'm here to tell you that for real problem drinkers, cutting back is not the answer. Abstinence is. Sorry, them's the facts. Anyway, if you want to quit, you can. You've never met anyone in your life who loves to drink as much as me and I haven't had one in about 16 years because of reasons. Lots of reasons.</p>\n<p>My inbox is always open.</p>\n<p><a href='https://rethinkingdrinking.niaaa.nih.gov/tools/worksheets-more/handling-urges-drink'>How to Stop Alcohol Cravings - Handling the Urges to Drink - Rethinking Drinking | NIAAA</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://www.hazeldenbettyford.org/articles/how-to-stop-drinking'>How to Stop Drinking Alcohol | Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/alcohol-use-disorder/how-to-stop-drinking'>How to Stop Drinking Alcohol, According to Experts - GoodRx</a>\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

Panicked, he sent a text message to almost everyone in the family asking for help. At this point, that means my siblings and his. We are a close family and several of us sprang into action. His brother-in-law lives a couple of miles away and was the first to arrive. My aunt, a nurse with more than 40 years experience was there within the hour. They got him to the doctor and then the hospital where the doctors are running tests to rule out a stroke. His thinking seems to have cleared up since he sent the original text but he still couldn't figure out how to set an alarm on his phone. That kind of thing is starting to happen with more frequency.</p>\n<p>Dad is the sole care-giver for my step-mother who has Alzheimers. She still know who he is, although most of the rest of us are becoming strangers to her. She still hugs me and tells me she loves me, but when she was recently asked by a doctor how many children my Dad has (four), she was unable to answer. Her and Dad were in a car accident last month and the next day she didn't understand why she felt so sore, unable to remember what happened. Even though he walks with a cane or a walker, Dad still cooks for her and takes her on the daily drive she insists on going on.</p>\n<p>My Dad was the first person I knew to have a computer. It was one he purchased at Radio Shack in the 80s. His experience with them predates Windows. Like lots of old-timers, he likes to talk about how much he paid for a 10MB hard drive back in the day. He used spreadsheets in DOS and used to be a master at writing batch files. Recently, he asked me to come help him with some IT issues. He has having problems changing the ink in his printer and wanted to make sure some important documents were getting back up. He's also mentioned not being able to remember how to access his photos or music. I was glad to help but I could see that he is starting to get frustrated by having to remember the procedures for tasks he's done for so many years.</p>\n<p>My Dad and I don't see eye to eye on many things, especially politics. I've never liked to verbally spar with him because emotions take over and I can't think straight. He has always been one of the most intellectually capable people that I know. A lifelong voracious reader, he's a walking encyclopedia about a great many things. Unfortunately, some of the facts he's assimilated in the last 15 years came from Fox News, an outlet not known for presenting both sides of an issue. We do best when we talk about computers or when he tells stories about my grandparents. There are a great many things he doesn't like because they differ from what he considers traditional. You've heard about the type of person who wishes life today was like the 1950s? That's him.</p>\n<p>Although he is financially able to afford assisted living for himself and my step-mother, he has so far resisted doing much more than just looking into it. He says that he is willing to pay for in home care, but so far he hasn't made any moves to get that underway. Maybe today's events will spur him into action.</p>\n<p>Every time I see him these days, I have to determine whether he's having a good day or bad day. He has a sensitive nature, so I have to be circumspect. I have done my best in adulthood to let go of resentments toward him with varying levels of success. It has not been easy and that's on me. I feel like he does the best he can. I might wish he were different, but he isn't. He is who he is, and my job is to accept that the best I can.</p>\n<p>As you may be able to tell, I am not a big fan of the aging process for me or anyone else, not that I have anything but wishful thinking to combat the process. I don't like the effects it has on me and I don't like seeing the way it changes the people I love. Writing this is the outlet for feeling that way.

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/linkage/mac-1.webp\" alt=\"mac\" /></p>\n<p>I started working in IT support right after Windows 95 was released. I’ve worked in manufacturing health care, banking and insurance, but primarily in K-12 and higher education. In some way or another, I’ve always been involved in end-user support. Currently I have a relatively low stress job at a well-run private university where the relationship between the IT department and the faculty, staff and students is pretty good.</p>\n<p>Almost every adult in 2024 has experienced technical difficulties that required them to call tech support, whether it’s the help desk at your job, your Internet service provider or the manufacturer of your cell phone. I’m not immune to this. I switched ISPs last year and my new setup didn’t work when I followed the directions. It was frustrating, but I wanted to solve the problem, so I called.</p>\n<p>I promise you that if you follow the steps below, your technology problems will get solved faster and with better results than if you don’t. And, trust me, I’m sure you’ve dealt with some incompetent or mean or unfriendly tech support folks in the past. I get it. That’s out of your control. What is in your control is how you react. Don’t act aggrieved or victimized. Be solution oriented and things will work out better.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Restart your computer. Seriously. This solves many, many problems. Do this even if you don’t think it will help.</li>\n<li>Answer all the questions you are asked truthfully. Don’t say you restarted you computer if you actually didn’t.</li>\n<li>Remember that the person on the other end of the phone almost always wants to solve your problem too. They are not the cause of your problem. Technology is complicated and finnicky and sometimes things don’t work. That’s the price we pay to live in the 21st century.</li>\n<li>Obey the Golden Rule. Talk to the person on the other end of the phone like you would want to be spoken to.</li>\n<li>If you are calling because you got an error message, know what the error message said and be able to relay that information to tech support. Don’t just say “I got an error</li>\n<li>Be prepared to tell tech support what you were doing when the problem occurred. (e.g., What program were you using? What other programs were open? Did the computer make any sounds?)</li>\n<li>If this is a reoccurring problem, how long has it been happening and what was your reason for not reporting it sooner? (Did you have a solution to the problem that no longer works?)</li>\n<li>Can you reproduce the issue or is it intermittent? If you can reproduce the issue, know what exact steps you took before the problem surfaced. (Keep in mind that intermittent problems are among the most difficult to resolve because of the difficulty in determining if the issue is fixed)</li>\n<li>What have you tried on you own to solve the problem? (Not that you have to solve your own issue, but it doesn’t hurt to Google it. It might be something simple that can save you a call.)</li>\n<li>Be familiar enough with the tools you use to know what operating system your computer uses and (especially if you are on a corporate network) what the name of your computer is.</li>\n<li>Do your best within your abilities to describe the issue. It’s not cute to use language like ‘thingy” or “doohickey”. If you don’t have the IT vocabulary to explain an issue, there’s nothing you can do about that. Just use plain language and you’ll be moving towards a solution.</li>\n<li>If you are having a problem with something online, try to know if your computer is wireless (bonus points if you know the name of the Wi-Fi network) or if it is connected to a network through a cable.</li>\n<li>Only call for help if you have the time to work through the problem. Don't call five minutes before a meeting or quitting time.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Look, I understand technology is frustrating. Trust me. I do. My whole professional life has been spent fixing things that aren’t working as expected. But don’t be angry at the person who is there to help you. There’s no need to tell them how many years you’ve been using a computer or what high-speed tech job your kid has. Just work together, get the problem solved and then you can get back to work.</p>\n<p>For Mac users who want to try solving their own problems, here are some resources.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.jamf.com/blog/mac-troubleshooting-101/'>Mac troubleshooting.

One of those is Shareful by Sindre Sorhus. The share\nmenu on the Mac seems like an afterthought when compared to the\ncomparable menu in iOS. Many developers fail to implement the feature in\ntheir apps, and Apple itself leaves it purposefully underpowered for\nsome reason. Thankfully, Shareful exists with three supremely useful\nfunctions.</p>\n\n<h2>Copy</h2>\n\n<p>Copy the shared item to the clipboard and so you can quickly paste it\ninto another app. This is my most frequent use case. I have a number of\nApple shortcuts that have text output. I use Shareful to copy that\noutput to use in other places. Without Shareful, I&#39;d have to use the\ntext to create a file, then open the file and copy from there. Another\nuseful option is to use this app to copy a screenshot to the clipboard\nthrough the share menu.</p>\n\n<h2>Save As</h2>\n\n<p>Choose a directory to save the shared item to.</p>\n\n<h2>Open In</h2>\n\n<p>Open the shared item in any app. You can open the current Safari URL in\na different browser. In Safari, click the share button, select &quot;Open\nIn…&quot;, and then select a browser. There is a Raycast extension that also\ndoes this if you are a Raycast user.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Frequent use cases:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>In Photos, use the “Open In” share service to open one or more photos directly in Photoshop.</li>\n<li>Quickly copy content from an app that doesn't normally support copying.</li>\n<li>In Safari, right-click an image, and use the “Open In” share service to open it directly in another app.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Shareful is available on the <a\nhref=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shareful/id1522267256?mt=12\">Mac App\nStore.</a> If you do not have access to the App Store, you can download\na version from <a href=\"https://sindresorhus.com/shareful\">the\ndeveloper&#39;s website</a>, although it is not updated as often.</p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Shareful - A Free App I Use Every Day' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

Here's a small collection of some of my favorites.</p>\n<h2 id=encouraged-to-leave>Encouraged To Leave</h2><p>I have been “encouraged to leave” both a library and a used book store — and I was totally innocent both times. I impishly asked a reference librarian if she knew another word for “thesaurus”. Next thing I know there’s a deputy sheriff at my elbow. I thought I was off the hook because I used to work with him, but no. Out the door I went. At the used book store, I was looking at a book on wine. This is before I quit drinking, although I was sober for the purpose of this story. I think. Anyway, I’m looking through the book and I start finding big, gorgeous marijuana leaves, dried and pressed between the pages. There were a dozen or more. Laughing, I approached the front desk to show them. They didn’t think it was as funny as I did, and...you guessed it. Out the door I went. I still like to read though. I’ve never been kicked off Amazon.</p>\n<h2 id=everything-you-need-to-get-on-the-internet>Everything You Need to Get on the Internet</h2><p>Back in the days when people were just starting to get online, Walmart ran a special on 14.4 modems, complete with an AOL disk and a phone cord. On the box it said \"Everything You Need to Get on the Internet\". Someone bought one and called me (I did side jobs back then) to help them get it set up. When I showed up, they handed me the box and looked at me expectantly. I asked them where their computer was and they looked confused. They pointed at the box - \"Everything you need to get on the Internet.\" They didn't own a computer.</p>\n<h2 id=two-boxes-of-junior-mints>Two Boxes of Junior Mints</h2><p>I have three kids, two girls and a boy. For the most part, they got along well when they were living at home. Group dynamics being what they are, there were times when they would go to war along gender lines with the girls using their two to one advantage. My son is a gentle soul who's never done a mean thing in his life, but he would get so exasperated at his sisters that he'd contemplate extreme measures at times. Once they'd done something that drove him to a dark place and he issued one of the most famous threats in family history. Shaking with anger, he told his step-mom and I, \"If the girls don't leave me alone, I'm going to buy two boxes of Junior Mints and I'm not giving them any!\" That was it. That was the meanest thing he could think of.</p>\n<h2 id=getting-used-to-farm-life>Getting Used to Farm Life</h2><p>Prior to the age of 14, I'd been a city kid all my life. Then I loved to my uncle's farm, where I lived throughout high school. When I first moved there, he also managed a commercial hog farm, and I rode with him daily to work. As we moved around from barn to barn, I did my best to avoid stepping in anything unpleasant. Since there were thousands of hogs around, this was a difficult task, and it slowed me down considerably, much to his consternation. Finally, he couldn't take it anymore. He grabbed me by the arm, bent over and scooped something off the ground and rubbed it on my hand. He said, \"Now you've hot hog shit on you. Quit dancing around and keep up. Let's go to work.\"  A few years later, I was out in the cow pasture at home with a wheelbarrow picking up dried cow chips by hand to use as garden fertilizer. He saw me and brought up the earlier incident, remarking on how far I'd come in my farming career.\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

My favorite person is almost always there. My Internet is fast and my beloved MacBook Air is positioned right where I like to sit to surveil my little kingdom. Whatever I like to eat and drink is nearby and if I nod off, which I am prone to do, there is no one to hassle me. Yet five days a week, I have to voluntarily leave my little paradise and go to work in an office where people ask me to do things I don't want to do. I have to do them on someone else's schedule and I don't get much say so in the matter. As hard as it it is to believe, I have been living like this since the early 80s. Remarkable, isn't it?</p>\n<p>The worst day of the week is Monday. After two days of relative freedom and being able to sleep at will, my entire system is shocked by the return to \"work\". Just when I am getting used to the kind of lifestyle to which I would like to become accustomed, I get the shock to the system that returning to the workforce brings.</p>\n<p>If you too share in my detestation of Mondays, I have done some research for you to help alleviate some of the downsides of the whole experience.

They want to know his last meal request and if he wants a preacher to be with him. Ultimately, they even ask if he wants a chance to escape. The prisoner, named John Coffey, tells them he's ready to go, starting his speech with a resigned \"I'm tired boss.\" Brother, I can relate.</p>\n<p>Most of my working life hasn't been spent in a physically demanding job. Occasionally in educational tech we have to install computer labs or do large scale moves, but most of the work is honestly spent sitting down, alternately reading and typing. Sure, it can be mentally draining to do something repetitive or to solve a stubborn problem, but it doesn't make your back hurt.</p>\n<p>I have had hard jobs that took a physical toll on me. I've worked as a cook in a busy restaurant. I've framed houses, and I spent time in the infantry. I've spent eight-hour summer days walking backwards down the highway carrying a heavy shotgun guarding prisoners the state wanted people to see out on the roads working. My teenage years were spent on my uncle's farm and if that man believes in one thing, it's teaching  young people discipline through manual labor. I'm not unfamiliar with fatigue.</p>\n<p>Even my leisure pursuits for years were spent chasing the endorphin rush that endurance sports can bring on. I loved 100-mile bike rides and backpacking over mountains. Building up endurance is an adaptive behavior. If you train a lot, you can do some pretty miraculous things.</p>\n<p>The tiredness I'm aware of today, isn't a physical feeling though. It might be me yelling \"get off my lawn\" at the world, I don't know. What I'm tired of is a world that seems in some ways to be evolving for the benefit of the investor class and not for the working stiff. The last thing I want to do at the end of the day is to go to the grocery store and ring up my own order. The store I go to just took out half the cash registers and replaced them with self check out kiosks. Who wants that? I go to McDonald's for a cup of their fine coffee, and the only human I get to deal with is the one who sits the cup in front of me. All the ordering and paying is done through a giant panel that tries to upsell me at every turn. I'm even old enough to remember the days when people didn't have to pump their own gas. Why was that eliminated? It seems to have disappeared at the same time that gas got expensive.</p>\n<p>I'm also tired of having to exercise discernment when I used to be able to just believe stuff. I could turn on the evening news and Walter Cronkite would tell me the deal, or may John Chancellor or Harry Reid. These days, I have to make sure I'm not in someone's spin zone when I try to stay informed. Newspapers that were institutions, like The New York Times, Washington Post and LA Times, are now operated by people who wouldn't be good contestants on Fear Factor. Some of them wouldn't endorse a presidential candidate, and they all lean towards sane washing the half of the American political system that is now ruling us. To be blunt, they have no balls, and it makes me tired.</p>\n<p>I'm tired of a political system that's caters to a powerful minority. In the US, most people support a woman's right to choose. They support raising the minimum wage. They support equal (not special) rights for LGBT people. Do you hear me? Most people, the majority, support those things, yet they are always in contention because a party that has only won a majority twice in 32 years uses every under-handed dirty trick they can think of to subvert the will of the people. It's obscene.</p>\n<p>I'm tired of things that used to be free or nominally priced. My kids grew up going to the state run aquariums located in a couple of our coastal towns. Today I have to drop a C-note to take my grandkids. Camping spots at state parks used to be free or just cost a five spot and now they cost as much as some hotel rooms. It seems like libraries may be all we have left, and thank god someone already thought of them. Imagine someone proposing a free service like that today. They'd be labeled a crazy socialist and chased out of town.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, there are some things left that give me energy. Being able to exercise free speech fires me up. Seeing my southern state elect a Democrat (who is Jewish) for governor gave me energy. His opponent had labeled himself a Nazi and said he's like to own slaves. We also elected a Democrat for attorney general and state school superintendent. The Republican who ran for the school job had said she wanted Obama and Biden executed on TV and homeschooled her kids over sending them to public school. I am not without hope, and hope gives me energy.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/gree_mile-resized.webp\" alt=\"Gree_mile-resized\" /></p>\n<BR>\n<BR>[Enjoyed it?

In high school, some buddies and I would sometimes sleep under the stars on the hillside beside the pond on my family's farm. Later, my military occupational specialty was in combat arms, so I got to spend plenty of time doing the Army version of camping at Ft. Bragg, Ft. Hood and Ft. Irwin among others.</p>\n<p>When my kids were old enough, we liked going to Cliffs of the Nuese state park where I told such terrifying ghost stories that my son late confessed he'd been traumatized for life. My girls could take it or leave it, depending on their mood. They are both adventurous adults now with kids of their own.</p>\n<p>Wonder Woman's daughters grew up camping with her and her parents but they haven't gotten into it as adults. Theirs are the kids who live closest to us. We se them often.</p>\n<p>Despite our backpacking background, most of the camping we've done in our marriage has been car camping in state parks. There are several within a couple of hours of our house. We decided to take the five youngest to Jones Lake State Park for an overnighter this weekend. We have two campsites, three tents, miniature camp chairs and lots of snacks. The kids all brought electronics, of course, but they are more interested in fishing, playing cards and exploring the woods. I did a little research before we came for some activities to do with them and that's what I'm sharing today.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.parents.com/fun/activities/outdoor/17-camping-activities-for-kids/'>17 Fun Activities for Your Family's Next Camping Trip</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://runwildmychild.com/camping-with-kids/'>Camping with Kids</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://www.discoveringanew.com/blog-4/outdoor-activities-and-crafts-for-kids-while-camping'>Outdoor Activities and Crafts for Kids While Camping</a>\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

Even for people who make everything seem effortless, life still has difficulties. In my more tender moments, as rare as they may be, I try and remember that everyone has rough stuff they are dealing with in one way or another and the rest of us may have no clue what that is.</p>\n<p>One of the most difficult things for me these days is dealing with the people who just elected Donald Trump. When I am wronged personally, I usually can get to forgiveness pretty easily. After all, we forgive people not for their sake but for our own because holding on to resentment is toxic and it just wears you down. Personal wrongs are usually about single actions, though. When a person's entire value set allows them to turn the country over to someone like Trump, it's an indication of who they are at the core of their being. Yeah, it's hard for me to deal with.</p>\n<p>I've reached the age where the people in my life from previous generations are all in their 70s and 80s. Watching them walk unsteadily across the room using a cane or someone's arm is unsettling. My uncle, who has always been the best example of strength and fortitude to me is still one of the manliest men I know but the days him being the first person I think of when it's time to lift something heavy are gone.</p>\n<p>Having been very physically active for a number of years, I have found it hard to bounce back after having knee surgery. The purpose of the surgery was to give me back my mobility, the post recovery. I just haven't gotten my groove back. At this point, it is more psychological than anything else. I want to go to the Alps with Wonder Woman in the new year. I don't want to have to skip anything because I lack the stamina to do it.</p>\n<p>Other difficult parts of life in no particular order:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Not letting how I feel be reflected on my face</li>\n<li>Being asked to do something for someone they should be able to do for themselves</li>\n<li>Remembering where I left my phone, keys and glasses</li>\n<li>Figuring out my cell phone bill</li>\n<li>Getting web hooks to work on my websites, although I think I may have gotten there</li>\n<li>Small talk</li>\n<li>Anything requiring me to open the hood of my car</li>\n<li>Saying no to my grandkids</li>\n<li>Climbing anything (life-long struggle)</li>\n<li>Listening to most 21st century music</li>\n<li>Anything without coffee</li>\n</ul>\n<BR>\n<BR>[Enjoyed it?

There is a\nfree app, Openvibe, that also works on macOS and adds posting to Threads\nto its ability list, but it&#39;s owned by some crypto bros and that may\ngive some folks pause. I&#39;ve been using a free service/app for a while on\nmy Mac and iOS devices that doesn&#39;t have those drawbacks, plus it adds a\nlot more services and has a built-in scheduler for up to 10 posts. </p>\n\n<p>Additionally, if Mastodon is your jam you can get all kinds of info in\nyour account including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Recent follows</li>\n<li>Recent unfollows</li>\n<li>Follower info</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The name of the app is <a\nhref=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fedica-social-media-growth/id6471431633\">Fedica</a>,\nand it is available on the app store. It also <a\nhref=\"https://fedica.com/\">has a web interface.</a> The platforms it\nconnects to are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Twitter/X</li>\n<li>Instagram</li>\n<li>YouTube</li>\n<li>TinkTok</li>\n<li>Facebook Pages</li>\n<li>Mastodon</li>\n<li>Bluesky</li>\n<li>LinkedIn</li>\n<li>Pinterest</li>\n<li>Threads</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You can post polls and threads on platforms that support them, plus you\nget unlimited drafts to store posts you may want to make later.</p>\n\n<p>There are some paid options geared more towards business owners than\nindividuals that offer scheduling more than 10 posts and getting more\nfrequent reports, but they are expensive, starting at $29.99 a month.\nFor personal use, the free options are fine for most people.</p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Fedica - Post to Multiple Social Networks at Once, On a Schedule - For Free' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/fannie_lou_hamer.webp\" alt=\"Fannie_Lou_Hamer\" /></p>\n<p>A certain type of person cares very much about their constitutional right to own a gun so that they can defend themselves and their family from any perceived threat. They obviously believe in the need for a violent solution to a potential problem and are willing to take on all the added danger that owning a gun brings to their lives. Hey, after all, who wouldn't do whatever it takes for their family, right? Usually, that very same person is also adamantly against providing any type of accommodation to immigrants from countries where street violence is endemic, making the U.S. the only feasible sanctuary. It might cost them an extra fifty cents a day on their federal income taxes after all. Not only that, the more brown people there are in the country, the greater the chance that they might have kids, earn the right to vote, or speak Spanish in the presence of \"real\" Americans.</p>\n<p>The same person who feels good because they adopt a kid from the Angel Tree at work every Christmas or because their church has a soup kitchen once a week has no problem supporting a political philosophy that would curtail food programs for the poor and eliminate Meals on Wheels for the elderly. They have a tremendous sense of entitlement for everything they feel they have earned and no sympathy for people who aren't in the same circumstances. Lots of people in the military lean conservative (not all though!). If you make a tour of barracks day rooms, you're likely to find lots of TVs turned to Fox News. Despite that, you will not find a more duplicitous, malingering, dishonest, getting free stuff from the government group of people than a service member at their discharge physical. There are people who specialize in helping them come up with every conceivable reason to get VA money for the rest of their lives for dubious medical reasons.</p>\n<p>On the flip side, there are those who put themselves on the line for people whose circumstances they'll never share. Every straight high school kid who joins their school's Gay/Straight Alliance voluntarily risks bullying by homophobes. If you look at the roles of civil rights martyrs, you'll see the names of people like Mickey Schwerner and Andrew Goodman who lost their lives helping people register to vote. Plenty of white people who enjoy all the privileges that their skin color gives them are adamantly opposed to white supremacy in all its insidious guises. Fannie Lou Hamer famously said, \"Nobody is free until everybody is free,\" and lots of people take that to heart and make it their creed.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure what makes a person lack compassion and empathy. Whatever it is, it's unattractive and malignant. When you don't care that poverty, hunger, and untreated diseases exist as long as you've got yours, well, you have lots of company. It seems that the price of gas and eggs is more important to a whole lot of people than anything that might help the less fortunate. And, that's just it. It's more often fortune that dictates one's circumstances than it is blood, sweat, and tears. It's fortune that picks your birthplace and your skin color. It's fortune that lets your job continue to provide for you when others lose theirs. It's fortune that your neighbor's house burned down and not yours. It's fortune that you don't have a crippling illness.</p>\n<p>I don't like associating with people who lack compassion. I don't understand their selfishness. I don't want to see them gloat and blame poverty on the poor, blame illnesses on the sick, and claim that any attempt to address the patriarchy, racism, or homophobia is \"identity politics.\" My people are the people who care. My people are the people who make a difference. My people are the ones who make whatever claim America has to greatness a reality.\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

TV channels, music services and software. Was\nlife better when we all just paid a single cable bill instead of cord\ncutting? Was it better when you had to pay an upfront price on any\nsoftware you wanted to use? I don&#39;t know the answer to that. I remember\nwhen it cost nearly $300 to get a copy of Microsoft Office with Outlook\nIncluded, which didn&#39;t include anything like cloud storage or a free\nemail account. Cable bills got to be well north of $100 a month. These\ndays, you can use Office in about five minutes for less than $10. If you\nget a good deal and sign up for a full year, you can often get a premium\nTV subscription for roughly the same amount per month.</p>\n\n<p>Keeping track of all this is challenging though. An old-fashioned\nspreadsheet might do the trick, but for a polished experience with a few\nextra bells and whistles, I use an app from Touchbits, Inc. It&#39;s called\n(wait for it) <a\nhref=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/subscriptions-track-expenses/id1577082754\">Subscriptions</a>,\nand it cost either $1.99 a year or $7.99 for a lifetime purchase ($14.99\nfor a family license). It is a universal app, so it works on your phone,\niPad and on your Mac.</p>\n\n<p>For me, it ticks all the boxes. It lets me categorize each subscription\n(entertainment, software etc.). I also have the option of using tags for\nfurther categorization. It can handle weekly, monthly and annual\nsubscriptions. There is a place for the URL associated with my account\ninformation for each sub. You set a renewal date for when the next bill\nis due and for what amount. There is a reminders option for those due\ndates. You can select a payment account if you want to track that. The\nSubscriptions app saves a price history so you can see what changes\nvendors make over time. Finally, there is also a notes field.</p>\n\n<p>The app has analytics to help you track spending over time and by\ncategory. There are several view and sorting options as well. The data\nsyncs via iCloud across all platforms. You can export your data via a\nCSV. It has a backup and restore feature, but it is a proprietary\ndatabase file and there doesn&#39;t look there is a way to import data from\nanywhere. I&#39;ve been using it for nearly a year, and I&#39;ve recommended to\nlots of people.</p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=The Best App for Subscription Tracking' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

Prior to 2002, opening more than one website at the times required opening multiple instances of a browser. Memory management wasn't as robust as it is now and computers had much less power. These days you often hear of people running hundreds of tabs at the time since browsers can hibernate unused ones easily. I am nowhere near that level, mostly because I don't have the headspace to make use of them all. I normally have two or three windows open at a time depending on whether I'm at home or work. Having 30-45 open tabs is the norm for me.</p>\n<p>If you are one of those 500 tabs open at the time people, please, please leave me a comment and try to explain why you roll like that.

Sure, people have varying degrees of talent, but I prefer an open society that encourages folks to try their hand at things. It is much better than one that acts like the plebes should stay on the sidelines while the real pros do their thing. That's why I don't find it the least bit pretentious when anyone describes themselves as an artist, regardless of the form they choose. I smile when I see anyone present a drawing or a poem or a landscape photo to the world. It's an attempt to bring something conjured in one's creative spirit to life, shared with the hope that it will spark a feeling in others.</p>\n<p>When I look at the effort it takes to write regularly, I know that it takes a muse of some sort. It takes real effort to come up with an idea, flesh it out, polish it and present it. I give bonus points when someone's post contains a hint of vulnerability, a confession that not everything in life is easy. \"Hey world! I have a wart! Want to see it?\" Laugh if you want to, that's a thing an artist would say. Let's face it, it's hard to come up with something original in a world filled with people who can say whatever they want, whenever they want. Just the act of trying conveys a certain sense of bravery.</p>\n<p>Emily Dickinson never saw one of her poems published, yet she continued to write breathtaking poetry for the entirety of her life. Stieg Larsson wrote the entirety of the Millennium Trilogy (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) and died before it was published and became an international bestseller. There are many other examples like them. Artists write because they have something to say, something they have to get out. It's not about being recognized or lauded as much as it is about creating because doing so is a representation of our own humanity. When Og, the cave man, was drawing on the walls of his home all those years ago, he had no concept of received admiration. HE just had something inside himself that he wanted to get out.</p>\n<p>Most of us have bloggers we admire. I told Keenan last week that I wasn't jealous. I just wished I could write the way they write. They responded kindly, saying, \"I like the way that you write like you.\" What an affirmation. To me it means I've practiced my own art form enough to have developed my own style, something recognizable. That's the thing about almost any skill. When you practice, you get better. Malcolm Gladwell famously wrote about the 10,000-hour rule, where he proposed that The Beatles, Bill Gates and other successful people reached the heights they did because of how much they practiced, how much experience they had. That's why I write every day without fail. This is my art form and I want to get better at it.</p>\n<p>That's why I don't give any credence to the criticism of blogging challenges. Writing every day isn't a gimmick. It isn't forced, necessarily. It is learned behavior and discipline. Writing is just taking what your thinking and putting the words down on record. If you think every day, and you do, then you can write every day. No one said making art was supposed to be easy.

There are services out there that\noffer to clean all that up for you, but they are expensive and require\nthat you turn your credentials over to a third party. Luckily, there is\na universal Mac app that can do total or selective removal of your\ncontent from 30+ different apps, websites and services. It&#39;s called <a\nhref=\"https://redact.dev/\">Redact Privacy</a>. It removes posts, DMs,\nphotos, videos, likes, and other unique content on various social\nnetworks. You can delete by keyword, sentiment, content type, and more.</p>\n\n<h2>\n<br />It has a free tier that will :</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Delete unlimited tweets, retweets, and likes from Twitter/X</li>\n<li>Anonymize unlimited Reddit posts and comments</li>\n<li>Delete up to 30 days of content on Discord &amp; Facebook</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To access the other services requires a subscription, but paying for a\nsingle month for $7.99 should give you adequate time to clean up your\nposts. Subscribing lets you take advantage of scheduled deletions if for\nsome reason you need that. The app is available on the <a\nhref=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/redact-privacy/id6449900531\">Mac App\nStore</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>The paid version offers:</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>All social media services fully unlocked</li>\n<li>Full access to the automated scheduler</li>\n<li>Deep-scan your posts with the File Importer</li>\n<li>Advanced social media management tools</li>\n<li>Edit and Deletion modes</li>\n<li>Priority, 1:1 support</li>\n<li>Custom text editing options</li>\n<li>Manage entire servers or communities with \"Moderator mode\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Included services include:</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Discord</li>\n<li>Twitter</li>\n<li>Facebook</li>\n<li>Anilist</li>\n<li>Reddit</li>\n<li>Linkedin</li>\n<li>Slack</li>\n<li>Imgur</li>\n<li>Letterboxd</li>\n<li>Deviantart</li>\n<li>Disqus</li>\n<li>Gyazo</li>\n<li>Pinterest</li>\n<li>Skype</li>\n<li>Spotify</li>\n<li>Steam</li>\n<li>Github</li>\n<li>Pixiv</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Redact Privacy - An App for Cleaning Up Your Internet Presence' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

After last week's election and Musk's role in it, there is another mass migration under way. Part of me thinks \"better late than never\" and part of me thinks\"you should have been gone already.\" To e fair, I wasn't a big Twitter user. I didn't delete my account immediately because I rarely used it.  It was never all that important to me and in my first six months on Mastodon, I posted more than I did in 15 years on Twitter. Still, I was very much aware of it and made use of it during times of fast breaking news. I preferred to monitor things like presidential debates through Tweets rather than subject myself to watching them on TV. When January 6th in all it's ugliness was happening, I followed it on Twitter.</p>\n<p>Anyone with an interest in the Internet or the social history of the 21st century might get a whiff of nostalgia looking over the history of the platform. The idea for it was sketched out in a single day at its predecessor company, Odeo. A picture exists of Jack Dorsey's legal pad with a rudimentary sketch of the information flow that was imagined. We know who the first person to coin the term \"tweet\" was and we know who and when introduced hashtags, a carry over from IRC to Twitter.</p>\n<p>To those who spent much time on the platform, nothing has really replaced it. I love Mastodon and plan to use it for the foreseeable future but it isn't the same. Neither in Bluesky or Threads or anything else. I don't know if the fractured outlooks people have on the world will ever again allow something like it to flourish.</p>\n<p>Take a trip down memory lane. Look at what we had. Look at what happened to it.</p>\n<p><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Twitter'>History of Twitter - Wikipedia</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/29/a-brief-history-of-twitter-from-its-founding-in-2006-to-musk-takeover.html'>A brief history of Twitter From its founding in 2006 to Musk takeover</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://archive.ph/lHXdM'>What We Lost When Twitter Became X  The New Yorker</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://en.as.com/latest_news/x-exodus-the-reason-why-the-guardian-jamie-lee-curts-don-lemon-and-millions-of-users-are-leaving-twitter-n/'>X Exodus The reason why the Guardian, Jamie Lee Curtis, Don Lemon and millions of users are leaving Twitter - AS USA</a></p>\n<BR>\n<BR>[Enjoyed it?

My ability to lapse into unconsciousness is my <a href='https://louplummer.lol/what-is-your-superpower/'>superpower</a> and one for which I enjoy a certain bit of notoriety among my friends and family. But, when I am done with a nap or a night's sleep, I'm not one to lie there and try to drift back off. When I am done, I am done. I'm ready to get up and do something else. I love to get up most mornings. The thought of that first cup of coffee and the chance to catch up on eight hours of missed news is too tempting to pass up.</p>\n<p>I am nearly robotic upon waking, which is normally around 4:30 AM. We have one of those wonderful Nespresso one-cup coffee makers that brew great coffee quickly. I stand by it, bleary-eyed but patient as I wait for it to dispense its life-giving elixir. I make my way to my laptop, disconnect my backup drive, and begin the morning IT routine. First, I start my <a href='https://amerpie.lol/2024/03/29/my-daily-note.html'>daily journal in Obsidian,</a> one I will transfer to <a href='https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/day-one-is-popular-for-a-reason'>Day One</a> at the end of the day. Then I add my daily app review, written the day before, to Reddit at <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/macapps/'>r/MacApps.</a> I don't even link back to my blog anymore. The moderators there added <a href='https://apps.louplummer.lol'>AppAddict</a> to the sidebar, and that drives plenty of traffic my way. Then I check <a href='https://social.lol/@amerpie'>Mastodon</a> and Micro.blog to see if I got any messages overnight. My friends in Europe are typically active already, so I see what they're up to.</p>\n<p><a href='https://louplummer.lol/wonder-woman/'>Wonder Woman</a> gets up at the same time I do. We spend the first 30 minutes or so together before she leaves for her morning run. Sometimes she's only gone for 30 minutes or so, but it is not unheard of for her to run a half-marathon before work, particularly if she's working from home and has a bit more time. Prior to having my knees replaced, I used to go for a walk in the mornings, a habit I need to rekindle. I loved being out on the dark streets listening to music or a podcast.</p>\n<p>One of the other things I enjoy looking at in the morning is retrospectives from the day's history. I can do this in the Photos app, in Day One, and on Facebook, where my account is now 16 years old. It's fun to be reminded of past getaways, and to see pictures of my grandkids when they were younger. What's not so fun is to see what outrage Donald Trump has committed on this date in history. As an example, today I see posts relating to his quid pro quo attempt with Ukraine when he withheld military aid in an attempt to get them to investigate the Bidens. That got him impeached the first time.</p>\n<p>By the time Wonder Woman has returned from her run, I am usually into the part of my morning that many people find funny. It's my pre-work nap. Despite just having slept for eight hours and having consumed coffee, I normally try to doze off for another few minutes before showering and getting dressed for work. For most of my working life, I had to leave a great deal earlier than I do now. I used to have to be on the job at 7:30 AM. My office was 30 miles away. These days, I don't have to be at work until 8:00 AM to an office that is less than 10 miles from home.</p>\n<p>As much as I enjoy my job, a low-pressure tech support role at the same university where Wonder Woman is a big wheel, I don't always relish the start of the day. I routinely remark with something grouchy and profane when she summons me to get in the car for my chauffeured ride across town to our lovely campus. By the time we get moving though, I cheer up. My wife is my favorite person. I enjoy the brief interlude to chat about the day ahead, to crack jokes, and make plans for the evening.

I found a\nsimple tool by indy developer Arthur Smith, <a\nhref=\"https://arthursmithdev.gumroad.com/l/TextCount\">Text Count,</a>\nthat makes it easy to get character, word and sentence counts and to get\na readability score on the Flesch-Kincaid scale. It analyzes sentence\nlength and word length, plus syllable count to assign a score from 1-100\nto the text. The higher the score is, the better. Most business\ncommunication should fall in the range from 60-70. A low score indicates\nthat you need to simplify what you&#39;ve written.</p>\n\n<p>Another useful element of Text Count is an estimated reading and\nspeaking time. The app does not require you to paste the text anywhere.\nIt analyzes what you copy to the clipboard. For people like me, who do\ntheir writing in a text editor instead of something like Microsoft Word,\nit&#39;s a handy tool.</p>\n\n<p>Some high-end writing apps like <a\nhref=\"https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/ia-writer\">iA Writer</a> have\nsome of these tools built in. <a\nhref=\"https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/obsdian-s-many-uses\">Obsidian</a>\noffers a word and character count out of the box, and you can download a\nplugin for a readability score.</p>\n\n<p><br />Text Count is $2.99 at <a\nhref=\"https://arthursmithdev.gumroad.com/l/TextCount\">Gumroad</a>.</p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Text Count - An App for Those Who Write' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

Starring Olivia Coleman, David Tenant and Jody Whitaker. Any of the three of them makes any show worth watching but the fireworks and raw emotion of Broadchurch are something special. Make sure you watch the British version of the show. For some weird reason, an America version was filmed and it is a poor comparison.</p>\n<h1 id=the-wire>The Wire</h1><style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/LYgKmOJT_gM' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Regarded by many as the best television show ever made, the five season's of The Wire loosely follow the Baltimore Police Department and drug gang while also spending time with longshoremen, politicians, newspaper reporters and school teachers. All of these intermix in an unflinching look at the intertwined cultures of a modern American city. The acting, the screen writing and the directing are all excellent. Some of the characters from the show live in my imagination years after watching the show for the last time.</p>\n<h1 id=the-sopranos>The Sopranos</h1><style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/2X4UhSPA5d4' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>A classic by any measure, The Sopranos removed the glamor and mysticism from the mob created by The Godfather and revealed the extremely flawed human beings who make it up. Like The Wire, the screenwriting and acting is top notch and the characters unforgettable. It's almost impossible to watch one episode at the time if you have more available.</p>\n<h1 id=the-fall>The Fall</h1><style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/dyFrBC1rAcg' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Starring two of the world's beautiful people, Jamie Dornan and Gillian Anderson, this story of a Northern Irish serial killer and the cop, imported from the Metropolitan Police to track him down is as suspenseful as anything I have ever watched. A scene that takes place in Belfast hospital emergency room after a shooting is a revealing testament to the combat medical skills doctos in that part of the world learned during The Troubles.</p>\n<h1 id=lonesome-dove>Lonesome Dove</h1><style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/q5vskCOPEeg' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>I regard Lonesome Dove as the best American novel ever written and this television adaption starring Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Duvall among many others may be the best network show since Roots. It tells the story of an epic cattle drive out of Texas and has everything you'd ever want in a western. It's a must watch</p>\n<BR>\n<BR>[Enjoyed it?

To further obfuscate things, I don't believe I am actually sick either, just feeling the after affects of a couple of vaccinations. This has happened to me as punishment for telling Wonder Woman that I've never felt bad after getting a shot, possibly insinuating that people who do are experiencing a psychosomatic reaction. She said her arm was a little stiff at the injection site, prompting me to wave mine around, windmill fashion to show that I was just fine.</p>\n<p>I generally escape the variety of communicable diseases that seem to plague some folks. Thirt years of working in the close confines of first a prison and then public schools seems to have given me the immune system of a plague doctor. While others complain of reoccurring sinus infections, bronchitis or other upper respiratory illnesses, I just get the sniffles once in a while or a mildly stopped up nose, both of which are adequately handled by OTC medications.</p>\n<p>When I do come down with something, I usually have company. Wonder Woman and I have lived through two bouts with Covid, a horrible flu and joint food poisoning from a sketchy Mexican restaurant. We lie in bed together so that our kids won't have to wonder around the house to find our bodies if we end up dying. The bad case of flu happened when one of our daughters was visiting at Christmas. Her family drove all the way hear from central Florida and barely got to see us since we rarely ventured out of our bed room as we did not want to infect them.</p>\n<p>I am not one of those men the Internet likes to mock when I don't feel well. I am not prone to moaning or any sort of drama. What I want more than anything is to be left alone. Headaches and bodily aches and pains tend to make me a little cross and ill natured. I usually don't feel up to any sort of prolonged conversation. I want nothing more than to be left alone so I can sleep. Sleep is the great cure all. The more I am unconscious, the less awareness I have of my plight and the better I like it.</p>\n<p>Being sick on a weekend is the worst. You don't even get an unexpected break from work since you are already off. Thankfully, my white collar job offers PTO so if there is a need to stay home, my pay won't get docked. I remember the jobs I had early in my life when no work meant no pay and often those types of jobs also wanted a doctor's note, forcing you to actually pay to take a sick day. Isn't American great?</p>\n<p>If I were one of those science denying Republicans, or RFK, Jr., I would be fine since that type no longer believes in the proven efficacy of vaccinations for some reason. That's fine. The fewer of those people in the world, the better off we all are. I know that wasn't a nice thing to sy, but you'll have to excuse me. I don't feel well.\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

If you don&#39;t have any text selected, and you invoke the hotkey,\nyou can type a query into the popup. You can choose the window size you\nwant for the popup, by selecting user elements for iPhone, iPad, Mac or\ncustom. You can also choose to invoke Snapsrch with a mouse or trackpad\ngesture. If you are a Popclip user, there is an extension available to\nadd Snapsrch. This allows you to consolidate any search terms you are\nusing into one icon, decluttering the Popclip interface.</p>\n\n<p>Other Snapsrch options allow you to hide custom elements of any search\npage you create and to have them load to a specific location on the\npage. Snapsrch has OCR capabilities in several languages, so you can\neven search for text in images and videos. There is a built-in history\nof your searches you can toggle on or off. It is helpful when you need\nto refer back to a previous search.</p>\n\n<p>Snapsrch is available <a>on the Mac App Store</a> for $5.99. You can use\nthe trial version as much as you want.

This is a story about a particular time on the Internet when ethics were a little more cloudy than they are today, or at least that's my story and I'll be sticking to it. Somewhere around the turn of the century, two things collided in my world. I became one of the first people in my city to get broadband internet by virtue of having signed up on the waiting list years ahead of time when it was first opened up. The other circumstance was the heyday of Napster, a program that let you share your music collection for the rights to access the collections of other people, which you could then download at will.</p>\n<p>Napster debuted in June of 1999, and by July of 2001, it was shut down by court order. This was a time before purchasing and downloading music online was widely available. The iPod and the iTunes store were still several years away. The way most people obtained music was by driving their car to the store and purchasing CDs. If you wanted to listen to music on your computer, you either slipped the CD into the drive or you went through a process known as ripping, where each song was converted into a format known as MP3. Hard drives were much smaller at the time, so you really had to keep an eye on disk space. I used a Windows computer I'd built myself in a giant tower that was almost three feet tall. It had room for three hard drives and a CD drive, all of which I used.</p>\n<p>Rolling Stone Magazine, then and now, was fond of creating lists of songs and albums for music fans to argue about. I found an article online with their version of the top 500 albums of all time. I copied the entire list into an Excel spreadsheet and added two columns: HAVE and NEED. I went through the list and checked off the albums I already owned. As a classic rock fan, most of the highly regarded albums by The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, and the like were ones I already owned. I didn't have any hip-hop, and my soul and blues albums were pretty sparse. It was definitely a white boy's music collection.</p>\n<p>Each night after supper, I would sit down at my computer and search first for entire albums and, in some cases, for individual songs to piece other albums together. I relied on a website that still exists to this day, <a href='https://www.allmusic.com/'>Allmusic.com</a>, to find the track lists for the albums since the Rolling Stone article I used didn't have that information. I would listen to the tracks to make sure I wasn't getting a live version if I was trying to build a studio album and vice versa. Some songs were shared at a low quality, forcing me to download second and third copies to find ones that matched what I already had.</p>\n<p>I was in my mid-30s while I was doing this, probably at the north end of the Napster-using demographic. The typical user was a college student with a computer connected to their school's broadband connection. Most people at home were just starting to give up their screeching dial-up for cable modems and DSL lines at the time. Because Napster skewed towards younger people, finding older albums—particularly ones that were out of print—was difficult. Two I remember searching for over a months-long period were Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music by Ray Charles, released in 1962, and Phil Spector, Back to Mono (1958 - 1969). The latter album, in fact, was the last one I needed to complete the entire 500 album collection. I remember the night I finally completed it.</p>\n<p>As a result of searching for and curating the editions of so many songs, I was exposed for the first time to classic 90s hip-hop in the form of Dr. Dre's The Chronic and N.W.A.'s Straight Outta Compton. I got my first Frank Sinatra album, In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning. Hank Williams, Willie Nelson, and Johnny Cash all had albums on the list, and so I found out that I enjoyed their brand of country music. I found blues artists like Little Walter and Bobby Bland.</p>\n<p>For a moment in time, I had a veritable music museum available to me. I could discuss and play just about anything a critic could name as being influential to the modern music scene. Over twenty years have passed now. When Apple released their top 100 albums of all time last year, I was deeply, deeply offended when I realized I didn't have them all. In fact, I didn't have anything by Frank Ocean or Kendrick Lamar, two of the artists with top 10 albums. Not only that, I couldn't even name any of their songs. That's on me. After Napster was shut down, I once again started purchasing music, both CDs and through downloads. My musical taste shifted from classic rock to alt-country, which is what I like to listen to today. For a period of time, though, I was on top of the musical world.\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

When creating alarms you can use\nabbreviations like 20m for 20 minutes, 11a for 11:00 A.M. or tomorrow,\nnext Saturday etc. The alarms are reusable, which is convenient if you\nuse Pester to remind you to check laundry or take a break at a certain\ntime of day</p>\n\n<figure class=\"attachment attachment--preview flex-col justify-center attachment--jpg\">\n      <img class=\"lightbox--image\" srcset=\"https://scribbles.page/rails/active_storage/representations/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBaWF1IiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--131b8aa4b26797c7442a854115987250b5408c79/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDRG9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJYW5CbkJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFJQUVHa0NBQXc2Q25OaGRtVnlld2M2Q25OMGNtbHdWRG9NY1hWaGJHbDBlV2xrIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJ2YXJpYXRpb24ifX0=--95bb9764b8481bddaaffec4af57d9e494bae5163/uber.jpg 2x\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Übersicht\" src=\"https://scribbles.page/rails/active_storage/representations/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBaWF1IiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--131b8aa4b26797c7442a854115987250b5408c79/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDRG9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJYW5CbkJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFJQUNHa0NBQVk2Q25OaGRtVnlld2M2Q25OMGNtbHdWRG9NY1hWaGJHbDBlV2xrIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJ2YXJpYXRpb24ifX0=--daf4078a1aefa3c961be2c7b8fbe4a74a2641c0c/uber.jpg\" />\n    <figcaption class=\"attachment__caption text-center\">\n      Übersicht\n    </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://tracesof.net/uebersicht/\">Übersicht</a></h2>\n\n<p>Widgets have become more useful as more and more developers have added\nto them to their apps, but there is still a use for widgets not\nconnected to apps to provide information at a glance for all sorts of\nsystem functions and external information.

One wears a hat and gray shirt, resting on a log.\" /></p>\n<p><strong>This question was asked by <a href='https://curiousmagpie.weblog.lol/2024/11/geese'>Curious Magpie.</a> It has also been answered by <a href='https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/11/ask-me-anything-3'>Anniegreens</a>. Do you experience Hiraeth (a deep longing for something)? What is it you long for - a time, a place, a feeling?</strong></p>\n<p>The greatest adventure of my life was my honeymoon, a blissful 156 day long-distance hiking journey that saw my new wife and I walk across 14 states along the Appalachian Trail. I think and talk about it often and probably always will. Even the best of regular life has its monotony. You sleep in the same place. You see the same things when you look out the window. The clerk you see at the supermarket rang you out last week and when you return next week, they will ring you out again. It's very possible to be extremely happy amidst all that sameness, bit it can hardly be described as an adventure. It's more like contentment.</p>\n<p>During the time we spent walking through the mountains, every day brought things we'd never seen before. Every night we slept in a new place, whether it was a tent site, a shelter or a boisterous hostel in some trail town. Long distance hikers have only three things that are constants: the unending evaluation of their energy levels, the location of drinkable water and the decision on where to spend the night. Everything else is just the relentless magnetic pull down the trail, putting one foot in front of the other, moving toward the terminus of their journey, no matter how far distant.</p>\n<p>The pure physicality of the journey makes for many, may opportunities for small victories. Every single time you make it to the top of a mountain, it means that you've won. Every time you wade across a river, your unbeaten streak continues. When you cross into another state, it is both a finish line and a starting line in a slow race to the next border. It doesn't take long during a through hike to achieve peak fitness. Any excess body weight melts off. There is real magic in knowing that you have earned the ability to do almost anything you desire with your physical skills. When you see day hikers along the trail, huffing and puffing as they labor towards a peak and you saunter pass them with your fully loaded backpack, knowing they are climbing but one mountain that day while you are climbing a half dozen, you can't help but appreciate the hiking machine you have become.</p>\n<p>One of the true joys during that journey was the chance to appreciate things we take for granted during our normal lives. When you spend most nights in a sleeping bag that is growing increasingly dirty as you lay on the ground inside your tent or the hard wooden boards of a shelter floor, the chance to get a rare hotel room as you hike through a trail town is magical. Sliding between clean sheets on a soft mattress with air conditioning is to experience true luxury. Imagine living off cold poptarts, oatmeal made with creek water, unrefrigerated cheese and the other foods that make up a backpacking diet. Then, while you're making your way through the incredibly rough wilderness of southern Maine, you come to a town like Rangely and you sit down for a restaurant meal of fresh lobster. You know in your heart of hearts that nothing will ever taste that good again.</p>\n<p>As adults without trust funds, we have worked without much of a pause since our teens. We were privileged to take a six month break from that grind because my wife sold her partnership in her business. Just the freedom to be able to live a life that isn't tied to an obligation to report to X location to do X task for eight hours a day, five days a week was a once in a lifetime opportunity. When you can live your life without having to be responsible to anyone but your partner, the days have a different flavor. People often remark that if the two of us survived teh stress of walking 2,000 miles together, then we must be destined to be together. They do not know how much truth there is to that observation. We became so in tune with each other, do defendant on each other for mental, physical and emotional support. It has lasted through the entirety of our marriage.</p>\n<p>So there it is. That's what I long for. All of those feelings and experiences during that period of my life are precious memories. I will always have them.\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

With it, you can bring back anyone from the dead from any era, at any point of their life and for only one day. Who do you resuscitate for 24h, at what point in their life and to do what?</strong></p>\n<p>This is the kind of question meant for me. I love history and I am prone to spending a great deal of time pondering things that will never happen. I have contemplated what I would do with my lottery winnings for hours despite the fact that I don't buy lottery tickets. I'm bad at math but I'm not that bad at math.</p>\n<p>After last Tuesday, I'm tempted to say that I'd be willing to bring back Lee Harvey Oswald. I'd get him a good military grade rifle, not that Italian made mail order thing he used last time. Of course, Lee loved Russia, having lived there. His wife was also Russian so it might be hard to persuade him to do the job so he might not be the best candidate for this experiment.</p>\n<p>With what America is facing right now, I also think that bringing back Dr. King for a 24-hour marathon strategy session would be a good idea. Aside from the power he conveyed with his amazing oratorical powers, he was also an organizing genius and man who could inspire others to do hard things. He successfully led the Montgomery bus boycott and the March into Selma. He advised the people of Birmingham how to deal with Bull Connor. I think he could quickly analyze the current political situation and help the resistance, such as it is, on a plan to mitigate the damage that's going to happen over the next four years. I'm thinking though, that it might be too heart breaking to only have him for a single day. I don't know if we could stand that loss again.</p>\n<p>As long as Paul McCartney is still alive, I'd be tempted to bring back John Lennon for a day, give him a guitar, a pen and some paper and lock the two of them in the studio at Abbey Road with a supply of strong tea and some good weed. There have been many good song writers in the rock era but no one even comes close to those two guys. I don't know if they could put together an entire album in 24 hours. I'd settle for just a couple more songs to listen to for the rest of my life.</p>\n<p>Since this exercise has been pretty male-centric, I think I'd better also think of a few women to consider. I'd definitely want to talk to someone smarter than me, someone creative with a unique way of explaining the world. Three candidates that quickly come to mind are Dorothy Parker, Virginia Wolfe and Sylvia Plath. It would be really cool if Denis would let me cheat and bring the three of them back simultaneously. Can you imagine being in the room to hear that conversation? I wouldn't say a word. They could all be pretty scathing and I don't think I'd want to risk becoming famous for being humiliated by a memorable one-liner.</p>\n<p>Forced to choose someone outside of the 20th century, I think I'd got with Henry David Thoreau. I love smart and eloquent people. He qualifies. I think I'd come up with a series of questions for him to pontificate upon. We'd go for a walk in the park that now exists to preserve the site of his famous cabin. I would tape everything he says and have it transcribed. It would make a best selling book and I'd happily live off the profits for the rest of my life.\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

After turning on Vivaldi&#39;s\nbuilt in tracker, ad and third party cookie blocking, I added uBlock\nOrigin Lite and tested security at <a\nhref=\"https://adblock-tester.com/\">Ad-Block Tester</a> and <a\nhref=\"https://d3ward.github.io/toolz/adblock.html\">Toolz Adblock</a>,\nscoring a 99% effectiveness rate on both of them. Vivaldi has built-in\ntools to block cookie popups across the board.</p>\n\n<h2>Power Consumption</h2>\n\n<p>Vivaldi allows you to set custom hibernation times on individual tabs or\non stacks, its name for tab groups. You can also set Vivaldi to  open up\nwith lazy loading, where tabs stay in a hibernating state until you need\nthem. I typically operate with two or three windows and 30–45 tabs at\nall time, so this presents a good opportunity to really reduce battery\nstrain.</p>\n\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n\n<p>To avoid distraction, I wanted to use the identical colors I&#39;d used in\nEdge. Modifying the default theme only took a couple of minutes using a\ncolor picker and hex codes.</p>\n\n<h2>Tab Management</h2>\n\n<p>When you open Vivaldi for the first time, you are asked to choose if you\nwant vertical or horizontal tabs. You can move them later if you decide\nto. You can also take advantage of split screen tabs, allowing you to\nview two web pages side by side. My favorite feature out of all the\ntools is saved sessions. You can save all your open tabs and reopen them\nlater from a button on the left side toolbar. This is a separate feature\nfrom the workspaces that Vivaldi lets you create and reopen as needed.\nYou can even go a step further and use a separate profile with a\ndifferent email address to keep your work and personal browsing from\nmixing. This lets you use different extensions, passwords and settings\nat every level.</p>\n\n<h2>Built in Mail, Calendar, Notes and Feed Reader</h2>\n\n<p>It was easy to set up my primary Gmail account and the Yahoo account I\nuse just for newsletters. Adding a selection of Google Calendars and\nApple Calendars was also a breeze. While I prefer to use my subscription\nto Inoreader for my full-blown RSS needs, it is convenient to stick a\nfew of my favorite sites in the Vivaldi built-in feed reader for quick\naccess.</p>\n\n<h2>Side Panel</h2>\n\n<p>Vivaldi has an option to any site you want in a panel on the side of the\nbrowser, helpful when doing research with Wikipedia or looking up\nbookmarks on Raindrop.io. You can also view your browser based bookmarks\nthere along with notes, downloads, history, your reading list, a\ntranslation service, a list of tabs from across all current Vivaldi\nsessions on multiple computers, saved sessions, calendars and tasks</p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=A Day With Vivaldi Browser' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

The scumbag billionaire. Marc Andreessen, was once a brilliant software engineer who led the way in introducing Netscape (previously known as Mosaic) to the world. The market share it garnered was north of 95%/ The next major shift was to Internet Explorer, the browser installed on all Windows machines from Windows 95 through Windows 8. It swallowed the Internet and eventually had as large a market share as Netscape ever did. Then, here came Google. It's Chrome browser is nearly ubiquitous today, despite it's many faults, primarily privacy concerns and battery drain on mobile. Many Mac users stay with the default browser on their computers, Safari, which is also native in the iPhone.</p>\n<p>Chances are, you are probably a Chrome or Safari user unless you're a techie, in which case chances are you may be a Firefox user since it has better privacy than it's main competitions. If you have been using the same browser for a long time, I'm suggesting that you try an alternative for a few days, just in case you're missing something.</p>\n<p>Every major browser has import options that let you bring in your bookmarks, passwords and history if you are currently using one of the major players.</p>\n<p>Here are a few choices:</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/download?form=MA13FJ'>Microsoft Edge</a> - this has been my workhorse on Windows, Mac and iOS over the past two years. It is a stable browser with a huge variety of features, most of which are easy to turn off are hid if you don't want to see them. It's based on Chrome, so the extensions available are plentiful. You can read more about <a href='https://amerpie.lol/2024/01/09/microsoft-edge-really.html'>why I like it here,</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/'>Firefox</a> - this descendant of Netscape is the one of the most private of browsers and it still allows you to use the most powerful ad-blocking extensions (<a href='https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/'>see uBlock Origin</a>) which are being phased out in Chrome based browsers. For an open source alternative using the Firefox engine, try <a href='https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/the-zen-browser'>the Zen Browser</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://brave.com/download/'>Brave</a> - this is another browser for the security minded with built-in blocking of ads, trackers and third party cookies, which also makes it pretty fast. It has a built in version of Tor for browsing that is untraceable for all practical purposes. Based on Chrome, it has a wide variety of available extensions.</p>\n<p><a href='https://kagi.com/orion/'>Orion</a> - a browser developed by the private search engine, Kagi, is also privacy focused, promising zero telemetry and the ability to use either Chrome or Firefox extensions. It claims to block more ads by default than any other browser. It is 100% funded by Kagi users.</p>\n<p><a href='https://vivaldi.com'>Vivaldi</a> - this browser's claim to fame is extensive customization. You can place your browser tabs just about anywhere you want, turn on ad blocking with downloading an extension, and enjoy end-to-end encryption of your synced data. I am currently giving it a try.</p>\n<p>I am not going to link to Arc, the favorite of many people over the past couple of years because its parent company recently announced they don't intend to update it any further and weren't all that clear on where they are headed going forward. IMHO, it's a gamble to use Arc with it's steep learning curve and radical differences to the browser paradigm right now.</p>\n<BR>\n<BR>[Enjoyed it?

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/-7.webp\" alt=\"TimeTravel\" /></p>\n<p>Ask Me Anything - Where (and when) would you go if time travel were real?</p>\n<p>Should time travel ever be invented, I think those of us living in 2024 are going to be pretty safe from being visited from the future. No one is ever going to look at this era and think, \"Man, I'll bet that was a fun time to be alive!\" Nope, they're going to look at this version of America and want to stay as far away from it as possible. In fact, other than the night that Obama won the election in 2008, most of the truly memorable moments of this entire century to date have been horrible, starting with the botched election in 2000 and then 9/11 the following year. Follow that up with war and the financial crisis and year after year of Donald John Trump and you don't get a time traveler Disneyland.</p>\n<p>If I could travel in time, I'd be content just to see of the 20th centuries greatest hits. I think I'd enjoy going to one of the monumental concerts from the decade of my birth, the 1960s. Of course, Woodstock is the first thing to pop into my mind, but it was pretty wet and muddy for a good portion of the time, so I'd probably choose the Monterey Pop Festival in June 1967 so I could see acts like The Animals and Simon and Garfunkel and get to watch Jimi Hendrix literally light his guitar on fire. I'd definitely go to Liverpool, England in the early 60s to watch the Beatles play at the Cavern Club before they got famous.</p>\n<p>I would go to the March On Washington in 1963 and watch Dr. King give that speech on the very spot where the 2013 version of me later got married, right on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. I'd like to go down to Mississippi after the Civil Rights Acts was passed and watch Fannie Lou Hamer vote for the first time. I'd definitely spend some time on college campuses, probably at places like Berkley and Columbia, to see the student movement in action. I'd go to the airport in San Francisco and buy beers for the GIs coming home from Vietnam. I'd verify that the right wing myth of spitting protesters is indeed a lie.</p>\n<p>Then I'd probably get back in the time machine and go back to the 50s, just so I could go to Yankee Stadium on October 8, 1956, to see Don Larsen pitch a perfect game in the World Series against the Brooklyn Dodgers. I'd get good seats behind home plates, and I'd be ready to watch Yogi Berra jump into Larsen's arms after the final out. There's not much else I'd want to see of the 50s, except maybe the look on Rosa Park's face when she got out of jail for not giving up that bus seat. She is one of my heroes.</p>\n<p>Going back to the 40s, I'd attend the funeral of FDR. If ever there was a right man at the right time for a job, it was him. He guided the US through the great depression and then straight into World War Two where he assembled a staff and alliances that resulted in a victory over fascism. I know he had faults. We all do, but he was a giant and there is a lot to admire there. I'd probably listen to a couple of Churchill's speeches in the House of Commons too. I'd love to be there to hear him say \"We shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be. We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing-grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills. We shall never surrender!” He's another flawed guy, but he did the job when Great Britain needed him.</p>\n<p>The 30s were pretty rough, but there were still some things worth seeing. I'd go right to the heart of Nazi Germany and the 1936 Olympic Games just to see Jesse Owens destroy the myth of Aryan superiority as he defeated the master race and won four gold medals in sprinting and the long jump. I'd laugh as Hitler rushed out of the stadium to avoid shaking his hand, and I'd smile as Owens mounted the podium to the sounds of the Star Spangled Banner playing for all the Nazis to enjoy. I'd also do whatever I had to do to find Woodie Guthrie and listen to him sing his songs, even if I had to make my way into a hobo jungle in the rail yards.</p>\n<p>I don't know a lot about the first two decades of the last century. I think I'd like to see that total badass named Teddy Roosevelt, the day he gave a campaign speech after being shot in the chest and before going to the hospital. Furthermore, I'd like to see big Jack Johnson, the first black heavyweight champion, defend his title. If I wouldn't stand out too much, I'd go to New York City in 1919 to watch the World War One victory parade to see the Harlem Hellcats return from France. I'd also hang out at the polls to watch women come to vote after the passage of the 19th amendment.</p>\n<p>Finally, I'd zip forward to other moments. I want to be on the White House lawn in 1974 to watch Richard Nixon get on the helicopter after resigning the presidency after members of his own party told him they would no longer support him because of his crimes, showing that people like Barry Goldwater had more morals than today's Republicans. Finally, I'd go to the Dakota apartment building on December 8, 1980, to try and stop Mark David Chapman from killing John Lennon. That would change the future, certainly, but only for the better.</p>\n<BR>\n<BR>[Enjoyed it?

Using a quick keyboard\nshortcut, users have been able to summon a window into which they could\ntype or paste information. Hiding the note and bringing it back was\neasy, but there wasn&#39;t a lot more to it than that. With the recent\nrelease of Raycast notes in version 1.8.5, floating notes have been\nreplaced with a new feature.</p>\n\n<p>Raycast notes now support markdown. If you know the syntax, great. If\nnot, the notes window has a toolbar where you can select bold, italic,\nbullets and so on. It also has &quot;inline code and code blocks, lists that\nyou can indent and reorder, checklists, links and more.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Raycast users without the pro plan can have up to five notes, while pro\nmembers get an unlimited number. There are built-in commands for New\nNotes and Search Notes. If you use the commands frequently, then, like\nany other command in Raycast, you can assign a hot key to them.</p>\n\n<p>The action pane (⌘+K)l for the Raycast notes command has several\nchoices:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>New note</li>\n<li>Browser notes</li>\n<li>Copy note deep link</li>\n<li>Create Quick link</li>\n<li>Format</li>\n<li>Disable window auto-resizing</li>\n<li>Export (HTML, Markdown, Plain text)</li>\n<li>Recently deleted notes</li>\n<li>Delete</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Quick links allow you to open a note with a single keystroke. The notes\nwindow may be moved anywhere on the screen. It will stay on top until\ndismissed.</p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Raycast New Notes Feature Available Now' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

Each one has a few good tips on being yourself and keeping your profile updated, but they also tend to veer into subjects like \"building your personal brand,\" using AI to \"help\" you and using scheduling software to help you \"maximize your engagement.\" I get some of that if you're marketing your lawn care service or jewelry shop on Etsy, but not if you are seeking community with fellow travelers in the 21st century.</p>\n<p>My reasoning for engaging is social media is two-fold. I like keeping up with my family and IRL friends, which is why I am <a href='https://louplummer.lol/why-im-still-on-facebook/'>still on Facebook</a> despite its evil influence. I also like meeting interesting and like-minded people who are into the things I enjoy, blogging, tech and furthering progressive ideas. I normally follow people back who follow me. I look at people with skewed ratios of followers as being maybe a little full of themselves sometimes, but it's not really any of my business.

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/chip2-resized.webp\" alt=\"chip2-resized\" /></p>\n<p>Today's question comes from the <a href='https://library.xandra.cc/indieweb-carnival/'>November Indy Web Carnival</a> - \"Has someone had a profound impact on you?\"</p>\n<p>My transition from a person who viewed the world as something that just happens around us to a person who sees the world as a place that is ours to change came about under the tutelage of a unique man whose life story is unlike anyone I've ever met. I became interested in a local group formed to oppose the death penalty. Even when I was an uninformed, apolitical prison guard, I knew at a deep level that state-sanctioned killing was wrong. Even though I'm not religious and the name of the group was People of Faith Against the Death Penalty, I decided to attend. That's where I met the most revolutionary man with whom I've ever been associated, a man with the unlikely name of Chip Smith.</p>\n<p>Chip was from Philadelphia's main line. His father had been a research scientist for a pharmaceutical company and ended up a wealthy man. Chip was nearly 70 when I met him, and he still had a trust fund left to him by his father, but he was hardly typical of that breed. In the '60s, while the war in Vietnam was raging, Chip had gone to work for the Agency for International Development in Laos, living among the American community there, rife with CIA agents and other clandestine operatives. When he returned to the United States, he fell into the radical left movement and stayed there for the rest of his life.</p>\n<p>American communist and socialist organizations have Byzantine family trees. Groups continually split over differences in political philosophy and tactics. I can't describe every group Chip was a member of, but in 1979 he was a part of the People's Viewpoint organization, composed mostly of educated professionals who went to work alongside the working class to organize them into what would hopefully become a revolutionary movement. Despite having a doctorate in economics and that trust fund I mentioned, Chip went to work in a steel mill and became a shop steward in the union. His wife, an actual neurosurgeon by trade, went to work in a garment factory. The organizing of the People's Viewpoint organization came to a bloody end in November 1979 when a rally they organized in a Greensboro, NC housing project was attacked by the KKK in an ambush the police knew was going to happen and did nothing to stop. Five people were killed.</p>\n<p>Chip's wife went back to work in the hospital, but Chip kept on working towards revolutionary changes in the U.S. By the late '90s, the organization he was a member of in Philly had a plan for members to move to the U.S. South to organize. Despite the bloody history that had touched their lives, Chip and his wife moved to NC. His plan was to join local progressive groups, assist them in their mission, and help them grow. He successfully mentored us into actually getting the city council of our city to endorse a death penalty moratorium in a campaign that succeeded. NC hasn't had an execution in 17 years.</p>\n<p>When 9/11 happened and the U.S. government went to war, Chip used his extensive contacts to help the little peace group we organized do things like help military resisters, hold giant demonstrations, and direct military families towards others like them against the war.</p>\n<p>On a personal level, he taught me so much. I learned about the history of the Palestinian people from Chip. I had no experience with organized labor or unions, being from the least unionized state in the country. Chip taught me what they've done for workers and why they are needed. Chip patiently taught me about the societal cost of white privilege. In fact, he wrote a book about it. Chip taught me about the importance of inclusion, about how as two white guys, we should work towards building organizations that valued women and people of color. I spent many, many hours riding around the state in Chip's old van, going to meetings at labor councils and organizations like Black Workers for Justice. He never talked all that much, but everyone knew him and respected him.</p>\n<p>He wasn't just a political mentor either. When I was struggling to get sober, Chip and his wife were there for me, kind of like loving but very disapproving village elders urging me to do better. Eventually, his wife took a position in a hospital a couple of hours away, and they moved. Of course, he immediately identified the issues most pressing to the workers in that area, joined a local organization to help them out, and worked with them until he died a few years later, dedicated until the very end to making a better world with other people.</p>\n<p>When making decisions, I often ask myself what Chip would do in my situation. He never got too bent out of shape about the news of the day, viewing the struggle for revolutionary change to be a long and slow, but constant, process. In these trying times, I do my best to emulate that thought process. I believe in my heart of hearts that people, organized together towards a common goal, have immense power. I learned that from Chip Smith.\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

If you are new to the platform or\ndon&#39;t want to make the investment in a paid program right now, there is\na simple and easy to use app for you. <a\nhref=\"https://macscheduler.net/\">Scheduler for Mac</a> can do all the\ntasks outlined above. It can run AppleScript, shell scripts and python\nscripts. Scripts can be run as root. Here are a few real world examples\nof how I use scheduling:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Open my web browser to my job's time clock web page four times a day to clock in and out for the day and for lunch</li>\n<li>Run an AppleScript right before I get up in the morning to eject my backup drive so that all I have to do is unplug it</li>\n<li>Run an AppleScript every night to move items in Things 3 to a new date and time</li>\n<li>Launch a file synchronization app every night to sync my Obsidian vault to Google Drive</li>\n<li>Open and close an app on my work and home machines at alternating times because I don't want it running on them simultaneously</li>\n<li>Launch a set of documents I use all day every day at work five minutes after I log in.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The interface for Scheduler is straightforward and easy to use. You&#39;ll\nhave no problem configuring any of the events. You can even group events\ntogether to run at the same time. Any event can be run on a schedule or\nset to the same time on specified days. You can toggle events on and\noff, for example, if you don&#39;t want them to run when you are on\nvacation. One of the conditions for setting up a script allows it to be\nrun after a specific period of inactivity. You could use this to quit\nyour open apps and log you off in case you forget to. The option to\ndisplay messages can be used as an alarm clock.</p>\n\n<p>Another powerful feature of Scheduler is the ability to assign hotkeys\nto events. Using this you can launch apps, open websites and documents\nand run scripts right from the keyboard. You can even launch them from\nthe Mac menu bar, which is a convenient way to do things like refresh\nFinder or restart your dock after making changes. You could even update\nyour Homebrew apps that way.</p>\n\n<p>The preferences and option for Scheduler allow you to sync or back up\nyour settings to iCloud. You can also sync events to any iCloud calendar\nyou grant Scheduler access to. Scheduler was released in 1998. The most\nrecent release was last year. It is currently on version 7. It&#39;s\nfreeware but requires you to register it after 30 days of use.</p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Scheduler for Mac - Free Automation Utility' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

There's something to be said for feeling your feelings and processing grief, but prolonged feelings of sadness produce cortisol and are physically, not to mention mentally, bad for you. Plenty of folks can have a couple of drinks or burn one and relieve a little pressure but that isn't an alternative for the recovering community or other abstainers. I thought I'd do some public service and research a few techniques on lifting your mood.

Any item placed on a shelf that has Quicklook capability is\nviewable via that mechanism. Dockside also maintains a recent files\nhistory in its interface.</p>\n\n<p>Dockside is an Apple notarized app that can operate offline since it has\nno external server connection and collects no data on users.

Spent a great deal of time trying to turn a 30 second task into a 15 second task by automating what happens when I download pictures on my computer. I looked for a new program to test so that I could write a review. I did not have the energy or desire to get far from my desk. I did absolutely zero doomscrolling of the news. I didn't read a single article about the cloud hanging over America.</p>\n<p>After lunch, I decided what I really wanted to do was just quit my job. I've already retired once, didn't like it so I returned to the workforce. I was looking for something to blame for my malaise today and instead of assigning that blame to existential dread, I figured it just had to be the low pressure, easy job I lucked into. Yep, that's it. I started emailing Wonder Woman all the reasons I wanted to quit. To her everlasting credit, she let me rant and didn't freak out. In the end, I didn't put in my notice, but I didn't feel better either.</p>\n<p>I don't want to go to sleep because I'm scared of what will be on my phone when I wake up. I mean what if the worst happens? I have no idea what I will do. For a long time I thought I would just withdraw into my hobbies, delete all the news apps from my devices and become apolitical, finding some way to not feel guilty for the fifty million tons of privilege that would allow me to do that. I know better. I've been reading the news without pause since the days of Watergate. I would not know how to stop.</p>\n<p>My entire early adulthood was taken up by 12 straight years of Reagan/Bush. The thought of my dotage being taken up by something worse is horrifying. If old, straight, white guys are feeling this way tonight, what must the politically aware POC, women and LGBT citizens of America be feeling?</p>\n<p>Is this incoherent? I don't feel like I have the words to express my anxiety, my anger and my confusion. It's not supposed to be like this. I'm so angry at the people who encouraged this, who allowed it to happen and who stand to benefit from it. I want someone to pay.\\</p>\n<p>I'm not a control freak. Most of the time I hold my chin up and deal. Like everyone else in the world, I've survived everything that has ever happened to me. I'll survive the next week and the next four years, no matter what. Right? Right?</p>\n<p>Someone asked me to write a blog post on whether I have faith in the future of humanity and I have been putting THAT off until after tonight because whatever happens today is really going to color my answer. That's overblown and over dramatic but it is also true. All we need is more air and water pollution and drill, baby, drill and \"I'm not a scientist\" types. I just want to scream profanity.</p>\n<p>America is a mental ward tonight and there aren't any doctors available.\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

It would be cool to have nearly 60 years of accumulated knowledge crammed into an 18-year old head. Let's go.</p>\n<h2 id=yep-go-to-college>Yep, go to college</h2><p>All the people out there making noise about how college isn't for everyone and that becoming a plumber or joining the army are good solid alternatives, you know the ones I'm talking about, those people are anti-education conservatives who went to college themselves and who plan on sending their children. They are trying to cover for the inability or unwillingness to make education affordable to the masses like the social democracies in Europe do—the countries that aren't sending half their tax revenues to defense contractors. People who go to college make more money, have longer life expectancies, and are happier than the people who don't go.</p>\n<h2 id=do-not-join-the-military>DO NOT JOIN THE MILITARY!!!</h2><p>I am a vet and I do not hate the military, but it is not a job program, nor is it safe if you happen to be female. One out of three people who enlist do not finish their service with an honorable discharge. The usual pattern for that segment of enlistees is a general discharge for some sort of misconduct, health issues, weight issues, or incompatibility with military life. For those who don't complete their enlistment, all of the wonderful benefits described by their recruiters are no longer attainable, including the educational benefits.</p>\n<h2 id=exercise-and-eat-right-starting-now>Exercise and Eat Right Starting Now</h2><p>Don't wait until you get out of shape to start exercising. Make going for a walk or run and going to the gym a habit starting right now. Just get used to the idea that you need 30 minutes to an hour each day to take care of your body. I'm not telling you that you can't eat pizza. I'm saying don't eat a whole pizza. Also, if you never worry about your alcohol consumption, then you are doing it right. If you do worry about it, that's a very good sign that drinking is not right for you. Weed probably isn't a better alternative. You need to get used to getting high on life.</p>\n<h2 id=start-practicing-gratitude>Start Practicing Gratitude</h2><p>Every day for the rest of your life, take a minute and write down three things you are grateful for. Your list doesn't have to be deep and philosophical. Did you find a good parking space today? Write that down! Did someone treat you nicely today? Write it down! Make it a habit to be continually on the lookout for things to be grateful for. It will do more for your outlook on life than anything else I can think of.</p>\n<h2 id=vote-democrat>Vote Democrat</h2><p>The Republican Party is a front for the top 1% of Americans on the wealth scale. They've discovered things that fire up white people and made that what they pretend to represent, but what they are really about is maintaining a system in this country where the richest people get richer and the rest of us fight over the scraps. I'm not saying that the Democrats are perfect because they are not, but they do not preach white supremacy, the subjugation of women, and the perpetuation of the war machine above all other government functions like the Republicans do.</p>\n<h2 id=avoid-debt-as-much-as-possible>Avoid Debt as Much as Possible</h2><p>Go to a state-supported school, preferably one that has reduced tuition. Start a habit of saving money from your very first paycheck. When you want something, start saving for it instead of borrowing money. There is a huge difference between what you need and what you want. Internalize that fact and let it guide your spending habits. You may want a fancy car, but what you need is reliable transportation.

Saturday he's heading up to Santa Fe and that makes him a lucky man. My wife and I spent a week's vacation there a while back and it was fantastic. There are so many great places to eat, hike, ride bikes and make day trips to. If you are into art, there are plenty of museums and galleries to captivate you.</p>\n<p>Here are a few places I can recommend from personal experience.</p>\n<h2 id=hikes>Hikes</h2><p><strong>Chamisa Trail</strong> - in Santa Fe is a beautiful hiking trail that offers stunning views of the surrounding landscape. It is a popular destination for both locals and tourists looking to explore the outdoors. You can find more information about Chamisa Trail in Santa Fe by visiting this website: <a href='https://www.santafenm.gov/chamisa_trail'>Chamisa Trail Santa Fe</a>.</p>\n<p><strong><a href='https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/new-mexico/armijo-trail-and-faulty-trail-loop'>Armijo Trail</a></strong> - Explore this 4.7-mile loop trail near Cedar Crest, New Mexico. Generally considered a moderately challenging route, it takes an average of 2 h 11 min to complete. This is a very popular area for hiking and horseback riding, so you'll likely encounter other people while exploring.</p>\n<h2 id=restaurants>Restaurants</h2><p><a href='https://sfshed.com/'>The Shed</a> - Located in a building dating back the the 1660s - We offer locals and visitors alike a time tested taste of the best that Northern New Mexico has to offer both in cuisine and hospitality. We are a family owned and operated business now under the management of the 3rd generation of Carswells. Visitors and locals returning to Santa Fe don't feel like they have arrived in Santa Fe until they have tasted the Shed chile once again.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.bumblebeesbajagrill.com/'>Bumble Bee's Baja Grill</a>- Great vegetarian, vegan and gluten free options along with organically raised meats. \"When we say the “freshest of ingredients” we mean that all our meats are freshly grilled to include a fine selection of skirt steak, natural New Mexico lamb, Mahi-mahi from off the coast of South America, farm raised shrimp, skinless chicken breasts and tender pork carnitas which are braised and slow-cooked in special spices. We also prepare whole natural chickens that are marinated with our secret recipe and roasted on an imported French rotisserie. Fresh vegetables and fruits are brought in daily to prepare the savory garnish and fillings that adorn many of the selections.\"</p>\n<h2 id=drive>Drive</h2><p><a href='https://www.newmexico.org/places-to-visit/scenic-byways/high-road-to-taos/'>The High Road to Taos</a> - This route takes the traveler through an authentic remnant of Old Spain, still evident in the religion, architecture, topography, history, and people along the route.\nThe byway travels through Chimayo, a community known for the beautiful Santuario de Chimayo and the El Posito, a hole in the floor of a side chapel filled with healing earth. Along N.M. 76, the byway follows through the creased and crinkled badlands, polka-dotted with scrubby piñon and juniper, with the Jemez Mountains enormous on the horizon.\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/opt-2024-11-04-1.webp\" alt=\"Paris Demo\" /></p>\n<p>My Internet friend, R. Scott Jones, asked - <strong>What's one place you've traveled to (or perhaps an entire trip) that changed you? Tell us how you changed because of it, and why you think it inspired that change.</strong></p>\n<p>I've lived for all but a very short period of my adult life in the same southern military town where I went to high school. Most of my vacations have been to the beaches or mountains of the same state I live in. My military service took me to places like Texas and California, but never out of the United States. Then, over a period of three years during the beginning stages of the US war in Iraq, I became a traveling fool. My activism against that war took me to college campuses and demonstrations all over the US and Europe.</p>\n<p>The way that happened was a matter of luck, politics, and maybe a tad bit of exploitation. I learned a lot about group dynamics, organizing, and the far left as it exists in the United States. I was a member of a tiny little community group in Fayetteville, NC, protesting the death penalty and other social justice issues. Then 9/11 happened, and George Bush and Co. decided to attack Iraq because 19 Saudi Arabians attacked the US. My son was in basic training in the Navy on 9/11 and was on the way to report to the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower after completing Navy Nuclear Training when the first bombs fell on Baghdad. He was home on leave and went to a demonstration against the war and held a sign that said \"No Blood for Oil.\" He was interviewed by an AP reporter. When he reported to the ship, he was brought up on charges and convicted. It was bullshit because even members of the military have free speech when they are off duty, out of uniform, and not purporting to represent the government. Thousands of GIs did it during the Vietnam War.</p>\n<p>I was pissed about the way he was treated and told the story at a small gathering of activists I attended. In attendance was an instructor from the University of NC-Greensboro who was a member of the International Socialist Organization (ISO). He led the student group there and had ties with the national headquarters in Chicago. He approached me and asked if I would mind coming to his school to speak, and I agreed. I didn't know that I was being auditioned. When I spoke at the school, members of the national cadre were there, and they liked what I had to say and how I said it. Before I knew it, speaking invitations started pouring in. I was eager to represent Military Families Speak Out, a national organization I was trying to organize for, so I went to every place I was invited.</p>\n<p>They asked me if I wanted to go to Paris to speak at the World Socialism Conference on an anti-war panel, and I agreed. I didn't even have a passport and had to hustle to get one. I was there for nine days. My roommate was a man named Shuja Graham, a former Black Panther given the death penalty for the death of a correctional officer in a prison riot, later exonerated, as he was not actually involved in the murder. I'm a former prison guard myself, but Shuja and I got along just fine. I met leftists from all over the world and started to see some of the nitpicking differences for which that strain of politics is known.</p>\n<p>I didn't do much classic tourism, other than visiting Notre Dame and the Seine one afternoon. I spent much time talking politics and drinking. I went to a demonstration organized by the French League of Communist Revolutionaries and bought a Palestinian scarf from the Italian Communist Party, whom I later learned were Stalinists. My hosts, the ISO, were Trots, disciples of Leon Trotsky, an early Communist thought leader assassinated on Stalin's orders. Most of my far-left-leaning political friends back home belonged to an organization associated with Maoism.</p>\n<p>When I returned home, I continued to speak out and travel, eventually going to Italy and Great Britain on ISO-sponsored trips. As the anti-war movement grew, some activists got lots of press, like Cindy Sheehan, the mother of a soldier killed in Iraq who gained fame for camping out in a ditch outside of Bush's Texas ranch. Another became known for appearing in Michael Moore's movie, Fahrenheit 911. GI resistors started getting attention and invitations to speak. People organizing against the war competed to see which well-known person they could get to come to their demos. Factions developed. It was distasteful. The ISO cadre, whom I had come to look upon as my friends, suddenly wanted to dictate to me where I could and could not speak, depending on the politics of the organizers. I was outraged because I was on one team, Team Stop the War. That was my goal. I wasn't trying to grow anyone's membership or advance some nuanced understanding of far-left politics. I just wanted for kids like my son to quit being sent to die in Iraq.</p>\n<p>Although I remained very much against US policy, I made the abrupt decision to quit traveling and speaking after making one last trip to Atlanta for an event that had nothing to do with any political group. Thereafter, I attended meetings of the same hometown organization I started with and went to our tiny demos happily. My adventures on the national and international stage were enlightening, and I got to meet a lot of military families and hopefully discourage a few young people from joining up. My adventures with the ISO, of which I must stress, I was never a member, were enlightening, if for nothing else, to see a small slice of American culture that most people never experience.\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

My\nintention was to keep a regularly updated archive of my 19-year-old\nGmail account containing 155K messages. I also wanted to retrieve a\nYahoo account that I use solely for newsletters.</p>\n\n<p>I knew beforehand that it&#39;s extremely easy to use Google Takeout to\ndownload an archive of your email in the universally recognized mbox\nformat because I&#39;ve done it several times. My Gmail archive weighs in at\nabout 8GBs. You don&#39;t get a lot of choices when you request the archive,\nthough. You get it all from the beginning of time. I wanted one to\nimport into Eagle Filer so that I could have offline access to all the\nreceipts, registration information and other things I&#39;d received via\nemail since 2005. Google Takeout did the trick.</p>\n\n<p>With Mail Archiver X you can filter the emails you choose to archive, a\nfeature I wanted. Unfortunately, despite supposedly being able to add\nfiles to an archive and cumulatively grow it over time, I was never able\nto get that function to work. Either the program insisted on downloading\nan entire archive each time it ran, taking hours, or it only downloaded\nfiles since the last time I ran it, but in a new file, so that I could\nnot search my entire account at one time. Their tech support answered my\nemails, but not with helpful information. The company is in the US and\nthe person who answered my email did not appear to a native English\nspeaker. At present, support is no longer free. They have a $70 fee.</p>\n\n<p>The other thing about the app I don&#39;t care for is its size. It&#39;s over\nhalf a GB. That&#39;s just the program, not the archives it creates. I would\nnever recommend this program to anyone.</p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Mail Archiver X - Give It a Pass' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

I didn't go to war, as the period between 1983 and 1989 lacked one to send me to. They only needed a few guys for the invasions of Grenada and Panama, and I wasn't one of them. I've lived in military towns for most of my life. I'm also a committed progressive, somewhat to the left of almost everybody you probably know. I've learned over the years that no one on either side of the political spectrum has an objective view of the people who actually serve in the military. People on the right insist that they are all heroes fighting for our freedom, even the truck mechanics who spent four years in the motor pool at Ft. Hood and got out. People on the left vacillate between calling them victims of the war machine and mercenaries, depending on which ones they are talking about.</p>\n<p>Practically the only folks who have an objective view of who soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines are, are those men and women themselves. Here's what one of my friends, a former special operations soldier (Green Beret) said about himself and his fellows on why or why not military service makes you more American than other people.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>They volunteered to be there, they get compensated for their time just like any other person that works any other salaried job, they have employment benefits rarely seen outside silicon valley and wall street, they travel the world, have the opportunity to pursue degrees at no cost, and the majority of their day is spent just sitting around waiting to go home. Once they leave service, if they have long-term effects from service they will be compensated for those for the rest of their life tax free, have access to healthcare for reduced cost, reduced cost life insurance, access to programs and services that allow them to build business, buy homes, and send their children to school with no money out of pocket, and will be able to tell outlandish stories with little ability to be fact checked even in our social media obsessed culture. BUT, they are more American because they do something that you feel guilty for not doing yourself. Like the garbage collectors, the police, firefighters, teachers, janitors, landscapers, painters, carpenters, roofers, plumbers, teachers, nurses, etc…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href='https://thepointmag.com/survey/military-life/'>Military Life | The Point Magazine</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://www.quora.com/What-is-something-that-civilians-dont-realize-about-the-military-and-its-members'>What is something that civilians don't realize about the military and its members? - Quora</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2012/08/06/public-veterans-agree-most-americans-dont-understand-military-life/'>Public, Veterans Agree: Most Americans Don’t Understand Military Life | Pew Research Center</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://www.dfas.mil/militarymembers/payentitlements/Pay-Tables/'>Defense Finance and Accounting Service > MilitaryMembers > payentitlements > Pay Tables</a>\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/opt-2024-11-03-1.webp\" alt=\"Lou and Wonder Woman\" /></p>\n<p>The November Ask Me Anything blogging challenge is going well. Today's question is once again from @annie@social.lol on Mastodon. She wants to know, \"What's an important lesson you've learned about relationships?\" As a happily married guy, albeit in marriage number four, I feel fully qualified to share my expertise on this one. Anyway, relationships also include friends, work, and more.</p>\n<h2 id=high-school-sweethearts>High School Sweethearts</h2><p>I got married the first time to my high school sweetheart. I was 18, she was 17. We already had a baby and had another one pretty quickly to boot. Today, all four of us are doing OK. Getting an early start on children made me a young grandparent able to do plenty of stuff with my huge collection (13) of descendants. Although the marriage didn't last long (three years), it did not ruin my life in any appreciable way.</p>\n<h2 id=dont-marry-someone-you-meet-in-rehab>Don't Marry Someone You Meet in Rehab</h2><p>I don't really need to explain this one, do I? Also, ten-year age gaps create certain realities, many of them not positive. 1/10 Would not recommend!</p>\n<h2 id=even-good-relationships-can-wither>Even Good Relationships Can Wither</h2><p>I think it's fine, healthy even, to have interests and hobbies different than those of your partner, but interests and hobbies need to take second place in a marriage. The most important thing in a marriage is the other person in it. Taking them for granted or assuming that all the hard work is in the past is unwise. That's all I have to say about that.</p>\n<h2 id=good-relationships-have-requirements>Good Relationships Have Requirements</h2><p>It is quite possible to be true to yourself and also put your partner's needs at the top of your list. My relationship with Wonder Woman works because I have respect for her needs. I know what things are important to her, and I accept that without argument. She does the same for me. She kind of had to train me, and I had to allow myself to be trained. I don't think either one of us has extravagant demands. We have evolved into a couple that spends most of our time together. Most of what we do, we do together. I don't go running with her, but I do go to most of her races. When we are at home, we spend most of the time in the same room, often within an arm's reach of each other. We always kiss goodbye, including before work, at lunch, and before sleeping.</p>\n<h2 id=work-is-hit-or-miss>Work is Hit or Miss</h2><p>In the job I retired from, I made several friends that outlasted my employment. A couple of them have lasted more than 20 years. We've done things socially, been to each other's houses. I've watched them get married and have kids just as they've watched my family grow. I believe in being friendly with the people I work with and finding out about their lives. I had the same boss for many, many years, and the guy was so disinterested in everyone who worked for him. He didn't know anything personal about his employees, and I just marveled at his indifference. Most work relationships don't evolve into friendships, but I think it's important to humanize my co-workers and not see them as cogs in a machine.</p>\n<h2 id=organizations>Organizations</h2><p>I'm an outspoken and energetic person. When I'm in a group of people with a common purpose and something needs to be done, I don't mind voicing my opinion about the direction we take, nor do I mind stepping up to do the work. I don't know how to be any other way. The upside to this is lots of people appreciate you. The downside is a lot of people resent you. I don't like being resented, but what I like even less is a group of people staring at each other, waiting for someone else to make the first move.\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

If you want a free app (donation\nware) to explore the possibilities of automation, try downloading <a\nhref=\"https://www.oliver-matuschin.de/en/projects/task-till-dawn\">Task\nTil Dawn</a> by developer Oliver Matuschin. It&#39;s an app with a GUI, not\na command line. You can trigger actions via events on your computer, or\nyou can schedule them. The program will run from a thumb drive if you\nneed to perform the same task on all the computers in a lab or an\noffice. Tasks are saved as files and can be shared among workstations.\nSamples include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Automatically connect network drives at login</li>\n<li>Automatically print all documents placed in a certain folder</li>\n<li>Automatically copy images when a certain external drive (including thumb drives) is connected</li>\n<li>Open or quit applications on a schedule (I use scheduling to launch a program that syncs my Obsidian vault at 3am, one that ejects my backup drive before I wake up so I can just unplug it and to move screenshots and image files from my daily work to a storage location when I am done for the day)</li>\n<li>Turn off automatic Time Machine backups and run them on a schedule</li>\n<li>Empty the trash on a schedule</li>\n<li>Take screenshots at scheduled intervals</li>\n<li>Display a dialog box (useful for public computers to pass info to users)</li>\n<li>Automate the opening of URLs</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are dozens of other tasks, and they can all be strung together to\ncreate a practically endless amount of tasks. As a bonus for\ncross-platform users. Compatible tasks can be shared between Macs and\nWindows machines with little alteration. The Windows download is also\nfree.</p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Task Til Dawn - A Free Mac Automation App' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/zhawv5iufgq-full-resized.webp\" alt=\"Happy, older man\" /></p>\n<p>In the continuation of the Ask Me Anything series, today I am tackling a question from Annie, first answered by <a href='https://gkeenan.co/avgb/i-remember-every-mean-thing-anyone-ever-said-to-me/'>Keenan</a>, <a href='https://blog.estebantxo.com/2024/11/01/if-you-could.html'>Estebanxto</a> and <a href='https://krueger.ink/when-perfectionism-hurts/'>Kerri Ann</a> - <strong>if you could instantly change one internal pattern/thing about yourself, what would it be?</strong></p>\n<p>This is an easy one. I would turn myself into a natural people person on the spot. I'd love to live in a world where relationships were easy for me. I can come across as personable and friendly, and there is a large part of me that truly is that way, but it takes so much effort. I make the effort because I enjoy the rewards and reactions I get from being that person, but my god, it takes so much energy and concentration. Left to my own devices and true nature, I'd silently do my own thing, content to be left alone most of the time.</p>\n<p>For a long time in my life, I acted very taciturn, rarely showing much emotion other than irritation. I was pretty gruff. It was all to keep people at a distance because I was so clueless about how to deal with them. I grew up moving once or twice a year, and my first 14 years on planet earth were spent always being the new kid. I didn't know what it felt like to be settled or to have long-term relationships. As an immature new kid, I felt like I always had something to prove, and if it backfired, my natural inclination was to angrily withdraw.</p>\n<p>In early adulthood, I dealt with substance abuse and mental health issues, both of which I sought treatment for, and after a myriad of struggles, finally got on top of. When I finally entered long-term sobriety, I realized that I absolutely needed people in order to be healthy, and that's when I decided to drop the gruff, grouchy, grumpy nature that I had always used. I was 43 years old. At work, I adopted the attitude that I would have were I self-employed instead of a civil servant. I really concentrated on being friendly and approachable and started thinking about how other people felt. I was at that job for 20 years, and I'm still friends with people from there. All of them will tell you that I had a mid-career personality change.</p>\n<p>In my personal life, I decided to start sharing the things I loved, which at the time were 12-Step meetings and riding my bike. I'd spent the last decade heavily involved in activism, always struggling against the things that made me mad at the world. Bush's wars, Conservative attempts to punish LGBT people, criminal justice inequality and more were things I organized against, but it had taken its toll on me. I stepped away from that and directed my energy into being the guy who was just grateful to be sober another day. When I realized I had a talent for endurance cycling, I became an evangelist about it to people who were interested, constantly talking people into attempting challenging bike rides of greater and greater distances. I met Wonder Woman at one of those rides.</p>\n<p>I finally learned how to make small talk. I adopted the role of a nurturer and started trying to make people comfortable, whether it was on a bike ride or at work when I went to help teachers and administrators with various computer problems. It was about this time that my grandchildren started entering the world, and I found that to soften me up a bit as well. I remember explicitly training myself to smile more.</p>\n<p>Today my problem is maintaining that friendly persona. It takes a lot of energy and sometimes I run out. \"What's the matter Lou? Why are you so quiet?\" is something I hear with regularity. There's nothing actually wrong. I just need some time to recharge my batteries and be still. By design, our home is a quiet place. It's relaxing. I have become an extrovert with introverted tendencies.</p>\n<p>When I look at people I know who seem to be always on their game, friendly and helpful by nature, I marvel at how they do it. I wonder if it even takes any effort on their part. I have a coworker who can talk to anyone and keep a calm demeanor throughout it all. He rarely complains and is always there to help when asked. Someone recently said that the two of us were alike, and I took it as a great compliment. Maybe I'm getting better at maintaining a friendly outside when my inside isn't feeling it. I hope so. It sure took long enough!\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

Then <a href=\"https://www.raycast.com/\">Raycast</a>\ncame along with it&#39;s floating notes feature, which is nice. It can be\nsummoned with a hot key. Then I found <a\nhref=\"https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/scrap-paper\">Scrap Paper</a>,\nwhich can also be called with a hotkey, syncs between computers and has\nan iOS version. You can hide the icon in the menu bar if you just want\nto use the hotkey. Furthermore, you can have the text window stay on top\nof all other windows, which is a feature I want. Finally, I saw <a\nhref=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/scratchpad/id6504040051\">Scratchpad</a>\non <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/macapps/\">r/MacApps</a> and I\nthought I&#39;d give it a try. It has everything Scrap Paper has, but can\nalso be launched from the dock. It adds</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Automatically creating clickable links from pasted URLS</li>\n<li>Control over font selection</li>\n<li>Text size adjustment</li>\n<li>Line spacing</li>\n<li>Smart quotes</li>\n<li>Smart Dashes</li>\n<li>Translucent background</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Because it&#39;s text, you get access to the writing tools, spelling and\ngrammar, substitutions, speech and the Mac Services menu. One awesome\nfeature is the ability to use Quicklook on a link, which opens a small\nwindow with a live view of the web page, similar to the Little Arc\nfeature in the Arc browser.</p>\n\n<p>Scratchpad offers scripting and shortcuts support. You can enter text\nonto Scratchpad from any app that can open a URL.</p>\n\n<p>There is a fully functional free trial of the macOS app available <a\nhref=\"https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/y4xzl0r4ifeml7ug3w603/Scratchpad-1.2.6-trial-1730450452.zip?rlkey=jfzs1u1iikns2dww21b9isw03&amp;raw=1\">here</a>.\nThe only limitation is a reminder to buy the app every 12 hours, and no\nautomatic updates. All data and settings carry over if you buy it on the\nApp Store.</p>\n\n<p>Scratchpad is available in the <a\nhref=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/scratchpad/id6504040051\">Mac App\nStore</a> for $5.

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/vote_with_check_0.webp\" alt=\"Vote_with_check_0\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Question: Why do you have the politics you have today?</strong></p>\n<p>In real life, outside of my family and a couple of close friends, I rarely talk politics unless someone says something real backwards around me, in which case I speak up. I consider any endorsement of what passes for Republican policy to be backwards, so I'm not going to let anyone subject me to it. I don't go around preaching to anyone and all I want is the same treatment.</p>\n<p>That's the root of my politics right there. It's the golden rule. I want to live in a society where people treat other people the way they want to be treated. Republicans want a two tiered system where there is a definite advantage given to white, native born people. They want to explain away the disparity in educational achievement and the rates of incarceration by acting like minorities are stupid criminals instead of using our joint national resources to bring about a better system. If I were poor (again) I'd want to be treated with compassion, not scorn.</p>\n<p>Conservatives want a government that puts more money in their pocket and screw everybody who isn't like them. I want a government that provides for the common good.  don't believe in a government that foster's an elite class who get to skip paying taxes on their yachts and jets. I think that the effective tax rate for people who live off accumulated generational wealth should be at least as much as the people who clean their houses.</p>\n<p>In order to have the kind of country I want, the insane amount of money that gets funneled to defense corporations has to be drastically reduced. Our government has a vested interest in keeping people scared of terrorists, the Chinese, the Russians, Mexican drug lords. None of the money spent towards combatting that lengthens lives the way it would if it were spent on cancer research and improved medical care for everyone.</p>\n<p>I want to live in a country with educated people because I believe education to be important. I worked in schools for decades and I know how dedicated teachers are. Republicans have fostered a narrative that schools are failing and it isn't true. They use any excuse to avoid spending money on education, preferring to give tax cuts to those who already have the most money. They  want to give money to private schools that allow non-certified teachers to tell children that men and dinosaurs walked the earth together.</p>\n<p>I believe in science. Only a fool would look at the rapidly changing climate and think the best thing to do is drill more oil wells, but that is the policy Republicans want. I want to drink clean water and breath clean air and I don't want to be told how spending the money for those basic life giving necessities sin't good for the balance sheet of some billionaire.</p>\n<p>So there you have it. Those are my reasons. I don't think the Democratic party has the solution to all those problems, but they are a hell of a lot closer than the alternative. The two party system is terrible. There is too much money in politics. I hope we incrementally change the system to something that better serves more people, especially those that need it most.\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

When I decide I don't need something right now, I place it aside because you never know, I might need it later. Therein lies a slight problem. She looks at my stuff with a rapacious gleam in my eye, and from time to time I get a wee bit offended and protective of my stack of eight different sizes of jeans.</p>\n<p>One place I can hoard to my heart's content is on my computer. I have stacks of external hard drives full of, well, stuff - movies, music, 25-year-old website archives, multiple backups of photos. I also have accounts in iCloud, Google Drive, One Drive, Box and Dropbox with files on all of them. I have files I created in Microsoft Works, a program that was discontinued 15 years ago.</p>\n<p>When it comes to music, of course I have a subscription to one of those all-you-can-eat services, where I can listen to almost everything but the ripped CDs I bought at coffee houses and bars in the far distant past, but I worked hard to download all that music from Napster and I just don't want to let go of it.</p>\n<p>I've carried a smartphone around in my pocket since shortly after the iPhone was released. At work, I have always snapped pictures of bar code stickers we used to identify computers, the admin panel on printers, lights on switches and routers and all kinds of serial numbers. I have a career's worth of those photos that I only occasionally cull.</p>\n<p>The 2009 iMac I used as a Plex server to watch movies hasn't been plugged in for four years, yet it and all the movies I ripped back in the days when Netflix sent you DVDs in the mail are still located in our family room. When I hear one of my friends talking about their movie streaming setups, I have to stifle the urge to bring them a hard drive to fill up for me. We subscribe to EVERY channel and don't have time to watch what we are already paying for, and here I am thinking of ways to get more.</p>\n<p>I went through a collection of articles I'd saved today \"to read later\". It went back several years, and you could see my learning and interests patterns through different periods. I had dozens of saved YouTube videos on deadlifting and squatting from my power lifting days. There were tons of articles on stupid shit Trump did from 2105-2020 when I was building up my encyclopedic knowledge of his many faults. I had to trash a bunch of NYT and WaPo articles because I'm mad at them and canceled my subscriptions. I had automatically saved the entire blogging content of two of my favorite writers, <a href='https://birchtree.me/'>Matt Birchler</a> and <a href='https://heydingus.net/'>Jarrod Blundy</a> over the course of 2024 and had to eliminate all but the reference material from those prodigious writers.</p>\n<p>Of course, I have every tech guy's obligatory box of various cables and connectors. You just never know when you might need a 30-pin iPod cable or s-video adapter. FireWire might even stage a comeback. Stranger things have happened. I think there's even a Windows 7 laptop, sans power cord, around here somewhere that hasn't been booted up in 12 years. We have an extra iPad that I keep trying to think of a use for, and I am still holding on to my last Apple Watch, thinking I might make it my nighttime sleep recorder. I've been thinking about that for quite a while.</p>\n<p>Anyway, when Wonder Woman reads this, it may be my last blog post, so if y'all don't hear from me, you'll know she beat me to death for not getting rid of some of my very valuable personal possessions!\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

I had a list of over 100\nURLs that I needed to convert into a Chrome bookmark file for an import\nI was trying to do. This involves going out on the internet to get the\ntitle of each page and formatting an HTML link, complete with the\ncorrect header and footer.</p>\n\n<p>I tried:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Google Gemini Pro</li>\n<li>ChatGPT Web Interface</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.typingmind.com/\">Typing Mind</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>All three of these would generate between 40–50 lines of code and then\nquit. The last app I tried was <a\nhref=\"https://elephas.app/\">Elephas</a>. I used a very simple prompt,\n&quot;You are a web developer. You create web pages based on descriptions\ngiven to you.&quot; The reason Elephas succeeded where others failed was\nbecause of the choices it offers in AI models and the limits on them. It\nallows you to choose between:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>OpenAI (15 different choices)</li>\n<li>Groq</li>\n<li>Claude (7 different choices)</li>\n<li>Custom (local)</li>\n<li>Gemini (four different choices)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I selected gpt-4-turbo and was able to set the context tokens to a max\nof 100,000. It took a while to generate the file, but it finally did it\nin a usable format.</p>\n\n<p>Elephas has a variety of pricing plans for both subscriptions, starting\nat 8.99amonthforlimitedusageupto249 for a lifetime plan with unlimited\ntokens. I use the version that is available through Setapp with my own\nAPI keys for OpenAI and Gemini, for which the charges are negligible.</p>\n\n<p>Another interesting feature of Elephas is its ability to scan folders of\ndocuments on your local machine and incorporate that knowledge into its\nanswers. I have an <a\nhref=\"https://louplummer.lol/.obsidian.amerpie.lol\">Obsidian</a> vault\nwith 7K notes that it uses, as well as a 1GB directory of PDF files on\nvarious topics. It can also do all the standard things we&#39;ve come to\nexpect from AI apps:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Generate ideas</li>\n<li>Summarization</li>\n<li>Write articles (don't do this, it's lazy)</li>\n<li>Answer questions</li>\n<li>Reply to emails</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There is also an iOS version of Elephas.</p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Elephas Did What Others Wouldn't' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

Create a cumulative clipboard with <a href='https://www.popclip.app/'>Popclip</a></h2><p>Popclip is an app that does all sorts of things with text you select, from sending it to different apps, to formatting it, looking it up on Google, adding it to your calendar. One trick I learned it can do is to create a list from things you copy to your clipboard, so that you can copy 10 different things and then paste them all at once.</p>\n<h2 id=2-access-menu-bar-commands-from-anywhere-with-a-hrefhttpsfolivoraaibetter-touch-toola>2. Access Menu Bar Commands from Anywhere with <a href='https://folivora.ai/'>Better Touch Tool</a></h2><p><a href='https://folivora.ai/'>Better Touch Tool</a>is an app that lets you create an infinite amount of shortcuts and automations with your keyboard, mouse and trackpad. One of the things I set it up to do is add the menu bar commands to where ever my cursor is located when I type the ⌘ twice. I don't have to remember any shortcuts other than that one to use all the available commands in any program</p>\n<h2 id=3-use-a-hrefhttpswwwraycastcomraycasta-to-auto-quit-apps>3. Use <a href='https://www.raycast.com/'>Raycast</a> to Auto-Quit Apps</h2><p><a href='https://www.popclip.app/'>Raycast</a> is a free keyboard driven  app launcher similar to Spotlight, except it has superpowers and can replace all kinds of other programs on your computer, like your clipboard manager, your emoji picker and your window manager. One cool feature you can use on a case by case basis is to have it quit programs you aren't using automatically. Macs do a good job with memory management, but after a while your interface gets cluttered if you leave everything open. Just set Raycast to certain quit apps if they go 10 minutes without being used.\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/abandoned-victorian-home-washington.webp\" alt=\"Abandoned-Victorian-Home-Washington\" /></p>\n<p>One of the central tenets of Buddhism is that everything is decaying. Eventually, everything falls apart. One just has to buy a home to see the truth in this. Trust me. Today, lots of people were disappointed that a well-liked Internet service, Omnivore, which allowed you to save articles to read later, subscribe to newsletters without using your personal email, and have some articles automatically archived, was turning off its servers on November 15. Some folks had just transitioned to using Omnivore, only to find that their efforts were now wasted. It was my favorite way to read a couple of my favorite writers, so I had to scramble to come up with an alternative.</p>\n<p>People have seen it happen time and again. Huge, popular websites and companies have just disappeared or changed so completely that they are no longer the same: MySpace, Digg, StumbleUpon, Epinions, the list is endless. We are used to it now. That's why I say people were disappointed rather than shocked.</p>\n<p>If you look at stats, the average length of time that people stay in a job continues to decrease. In 2024, it's a reality that in order to grow your wages, you often have to move from one employer to another. Pensions are very rare these days. Most of us have self-funded retirement; some are lucky to have an employer contribution, but our accounts are portable, unlike in the past. Even jobs that were once looked at as lifetime opportunities aren't the same anymore. I am a retired state employee, and one of the benefits I earned is lifetime health insurance. Too bad for new hires, though. The Republican state legislature took that away from future retirees, including teachers.</p>\n<p>I have seen landmark restaurants close their doors forever. It makes me really sad to think that my beloved Zorbas, the diner at the end of my street where I have eaten for 30 years, will be gone one day. I don't think that one set of my grandchildren has ever spent the night with us without going there for pancakes on a weekend morning. Things can be so central to our lives, and then one day they are just gone.</p>\n<p>Some great films from the early days of the movie industry weren't preserved, and the works of people like Rudolph Valentino, Clara Bow, and many others from the silent era will never be seen again. The military records of hundreds of thousands of World War Two veterans were burned in a fire at a VA records warehouse in the '60s, and the information on them is not retrievable. People think that the advent of computers means that data will last forever, but that's not true. CDs, floppy disks, and hard drives all have life spans, and if the data, whether it be pictures or music or books, isn't continually moved from one medium to another, one day it will be gone.</p>\n<p>I am of an age where my much-loved grandparents are long gone. Nobody likes to dwell on death, but we know that as we age, the frequency at which we confront it accelerates. Our relatives, our peers, our heroes, and idols begin to leave. I still find it hard to believe that I live in a world without people like Muhammed Ali and Hank Aaron, but I do.</p>\n<p>So, as trite as it may be, I'm using this reflection to encourage you (and myself) to savor what we have right now. Call your mom. Eat at your favorite restaurant. Read your favorite magazine. Watch your favorite TV show. Enjoy it all. One day it will all be gone.\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

Today, many people were disappointed to hear that an incredibly useful and free read-it-later service, Omnivore had been purchased by another company. The announcement email gave users until November 15 to export their saved articles, stating that the companies server's would be erased after that date.</p>\n<p>There are a number of other read-it-later services and apps people can turn to. My choice is one that's been around a long time, <a href='https://getpocket.com/'>Pocket</a>, owned by the Mozilla foundation, the organization behind the popular Firefox browser. I like Pocket because it's affordable, less than $4 a month when you pay for a full year. It's archiving feature is limitless and it saves a copy of the articles you add regardless of whether they are later removed by the original publisher. You can add multiple tags to your saved articles and it call all be exported to extensible apps like Obsidian. You can save articles to Pocket with a browser extension or straight from an RSS reader like Inoreader.</p>\n<p>Other options include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href='https://www.instapaper.com/'>Instapaper</a></li>\n<li><a href='https://readwise.io/'>Readwise</a></li>\n<li><a href='https://hq.getmatter.com/'>Matter</a></li>\n<li><a href='https://apps.apple.com/us/app/goodlinks/id1474335294'>Goodlinks App</a></li>\n<li><a href='https://apps.apple.com/us/app/anybox-bookmark-read-later/id1593408455'>Anybox App</a><BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/fredrogers.webp\" alt=\"Fred Rogers\" /></p>\n<p>A long time ago, a friend of mine told me that in life, you find what you look for. I believe that to be true most of the time. I'm always on the lookout for nice people. Thinking about them is a tool I use in my personal gratitude practice, a daily exercise where I record three things I'm grateful for. I have been doing it for years. There's never been a time in my life when I couldn't find some folks with kindness in their heart. Even during the years when I worked as a prison guard, there were inmates who did kind things in a non-manipulative way. I used to drink coffee continually on that job. You could buy a packet of Taster's Choice in the canteen for a dime in those days. An old con who cleaned the area around my desk gave me some sage advice one day. \"Mr Plummer,\" he said, \"Don't ever put that coffee cup down and turn your back on it. These boys will spit in it if you do.\" It's been almost 40 years since he told me that and I still remember him for saving me from that indignity.</p>\n<p>During the years I worked as an IT tech in the school system, I would always be showered with gifts at Christmas. Teachers would bring me baked goods, iTunes gift cards, coupon books, CDs and more. With all that teaching involves, remembering the guy who comes around once in a while to look at your laptop takes some real effort. When I took a mid-career break to get married and go hiking for six months, many of those teachers send care packages to my wife and I with edible treats, socks, bug spray and other things from our wish list.</p>\n<p>People with demanding, public facing jobs who maintain their cool and make others feel welcome have a special gift. The wait staff at my favorite diner, even when they are slammed, still acknowledge their regulars. They are still nice and patient with kids. They take a minute to crack jokes and to make fun of me for always ordering the same thing.</p>\n<p>So many of the tools I've learned to love on my computer are apps that some developer has made and given away for free. Everything I know about creating a blog is a result of freely distributed guides and tutorials.  The number of letters I've gotten from complete strangers on the Internet to thank me for something or to encourage me or to praise me is just astounding. People will go out of their way just to make someone else feel good and I think that is awesome. Yes, I have also experienced some meanness online but it's overshadowed by kindness.</p>\n<p>I think often about some of the giants I have know who dedicated their lives to the social justice movement. I know men and women who worked in the deep south during the Civil Rights era at great danger to themselves. I know organizers who survived the 1979 Greensboro Massacre who are still committed to the cause of helping poor people. I know union workers who've left home to travel to other areas to help organize workers so that they might enjoy the same benefits. I know soldiers who, sickened by war, laid down their rifles to speak out to try and stop the senseless killing that our government asked them to do in the nebulous name of freedom.</p>\n<p>Look for kind people today. Better yet, be kind. Get your name added to someone's gratitude list.\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

One thing it doesn&#39;t do is\ncontrol items that launch in the background.</p>\n\n<p>Today I found an app that does a good job with that aspect of app\nmanagement. Coincidentally, it&#39;s also called <a\nhref=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/startup-manager/id1296723195?mt=12\">Startup\nManager</a>, but it&#39;s a totally different app by a different developer,\nSystweak Software (Shrishail Rana). Where it shines is in telling you\nall the apps that you have installed that have background processes,\neven if they are disabled. In the system settings for macOS, some\nbackground processes are identified by the name of the developer rather\nthan the name of the app, making it confusing to sort out what you are\ntrying to control. Startup Manager identifies all the processes using\nthe name of the associated app.</p>\n\n<p>The recently updated app (September 2024) provides information on\nbrowser extensions, Kernel extensions, Launch items, Library inserts,\nLogin items, and Spotlight importers. In the login items, launch items\nand browser plugins categories you can enable/disable each item, delete\nit, get information about it and see where it&#39;s located in the Finder.</p>\n\n<p>By default, Apple&#39;s applications are not shown, but you can toggle them\non if desired.</p>\n\n<p>Startup manager is free and can ve downloaded in the <a\nhref=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/startup-manager/id1296723195?mt=12\">Mac\nApp Store.</a><br /></p>\n\n<figure class=\"attachment attachment--preview flex-col justify-center attachment--jpg\">\n      <img class=\"lightbox--image\" srcset=\"https://scribbles.page/rails/active_storage/representations/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBbXFtIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--e10dec0eaf20ebc68aa9d23563fcf5c6ef6a00c4/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDRG9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJYW5CbkJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFJQUVHa0NBQXc2Q25OaGRtVnlld2M2Q25OMGNtbHdWRG9NY1hWaGJHbDBlV2xrIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJ2YXJpYXRpb24ifX0=--95bb9764b8481bddaaffec4af57d9e494bae5163/CleanShot%202024-10-28%20at%2018.22.00@2x.jpg 2x\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Apple System Setting Interface\" src=\"https://scribbles.page/rails/active_storage/representations/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBbXFtIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--e10dec0eaf20ebc68aa9d23563fcf5c6ef6a00c4/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDRG9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJYW5CbkJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFJQUNHa0NBQVk2Q25OaGRtVnlld2M2Q25OMGNtbHdWRG9NY1hWaGJHbDBlV2xrIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJ2YXJpYXRpb24ifX0=--daf4078a1aefa3c961be2c7b8fbe4a74a2641c0c/CleanShot%202024-10-28%20at%2018.22.00@2x.jpg\" />\n    <figcaption class=\"attachment__caption text-center\">\n      Apple System Setting Interface\n    </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=A Different App for Managing Background Items' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

It's so weird to be getting ready to start my seventh decade on earth while simultaneously being able to recall events from the past as if they happened yesterday. In some ways, it is almost inconceivable that high school happened 40+ years ago. I had dinner with my brother (58) and sister (56) the other night along with my mother (77) and we were recalling events from growing up as if they just happened last week.</p>\n<p>I've been going gray for years. Not only that, but I wear a full beard and it is 100% white. Wonder Woman told me today that one of our grandkids said to her recently, \"Nana you might be old, but at least you're not as old as Papa.\" For the record, we are less than two years apart. Still, there has been more than one occasion when we've eaten together, and they've extended a senior discount to me (I'm not old enough) and not to her. Sometimes I feel like I'm in a Sci-fi novel, married to an immortal who doesn't age. She was furious when Kamala Harris first named Tim Walz as her running mate because she thought he was just another old white man. Once she found out that Kamala and Tim are are the same age that he is cool AF, she calmed down.</p>\n<p>I charged full steam ahead through my 40s and early 50s, hiking the Appalachian Trail and completing 83 century rides on my bicycle. I thought I'd be going like that for decades until arthritis brought me to a screeching halt and I had to have both knees replaced. Plenty of people go on to have very active lives after that surgery, so there is still hope that I'll get some of that mojo back. My mom walked across England and hiked the Camino de Santiago in Spain in her 70s.</p>\n<p>Our oldest grandchildren have graduated from high school now. It won't be long before we are great-grandparents. It's funny because all of my siblings, none of whom got married or had kids early like me, all have children the same ages as my grandchildren. I grumbled for years that I didn't like kids, but it was all a facade. I worked in primary and elementary schools for two decades, and being a grandparent has been one of the best experiences of my life.</p>\n<p>I'm trying to be OK with the fact that I don't feel like my time on earth is unlimited like I have for most of my life. Not being a religious person, there are no thoughts of an afterlife. Every time I do something unhealthy, I immediately have the thought that I'm robbing myself of time. I wish I could say that I am them immediately motivated to then eat some spinach and power walk around the block, but so far that has not been the effect.</p>\n<p>I have got to say that I enjoy having been around enough to be retired from my career job. It's cool going to work these days because I want to, not because I have to. I could stop at any time. That's pretty empowering. It makes the crappy days that inevitably happen at work more bearable. I'm not even the oldest person in my office. Our database manager is three years my senior, and she takes no shit from anyone. She's my role model.</p>\n<p>I can accept my eyes getting weaker and my gait getting slower. As far as I can tell, my mind isn't slipping yet. Both my parents are still alive, so family history indicates that I probably have quite a few years left. I hope so. There is so much more to write about.\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

I was a wee bit busy this weekend being a supportive husband and was away from my computer)</p>\n<p>I often make the comment on Reddit or Mastodon that Obsidian, a cross-platform note-taking application, is my favorite piece of software since Netscape Navigator 2, the browser that practically everyone used when we transitioned from AOL and CompuServe to the real Internet back in the 90s. Back then, we discovered new and interesting web pages daily. The Internet was full of hastily constructed and esoteric material, and it all seemed so magical. For our whole lives, we'd had to wait until 10 past the hour for the radio to give us a weather forecast, and now we could use this marvelous piece of software to go to weather.com whenever we were curious. It was revolutionary and amazing, and it took a while to get used to.</p>\n<p>Eventually we did get used to it, along with all the other marvels over the past nearly 30 years. I find myself quite jaded sometimes. The computer I carry in my pocket can do almost anything, and I'm still referring to it as a phone, the same name I used for the hard-wired wall mounted rotary dialed device at my grandmother's house. I no longer marvel at being able to do my Christmas shopping from my couch or following a baseball game pitch by pitch, knowing the speed of every thrown ball and the batting average of every hitter right up to that at bat.</p>\n<p>I experienced an Internet revival late last year. After an aborted attempt to retire early, I'd lost interest in keeping up with technology. I quit following the news, stopped downloading software and spent hours scrolling trash subreddits like \"Am I the Asshole\". Out of desperation, I went back to work to have something to do. Even though I went back into the IT field, I was still ambivalent. Instead of being on a Mac like I was used to, I was assigned a slow old Dell full of Microsoft software. It did not spark joy. Then one day I picked up my old iPad and for some reason launched my RSS reader. Many of the blog feeds were years old and dead, but some were still active. I started reading them, first from boredom and then with interest. People were talking about apps I'd never heard of. I cracked open my MacBook and started downloading updates for the OS and the hundreds of apps I'd collected over the years. It took a while.</p>\n<p>A British blogger, Robb Knight, had <a href='https://defaults.rknight.me/'>created a page where people were listing their default apps</a> in all kinds of categories. I wanted to get on the fun. I'd been working in the Apple/Mac/iOS space since the late 90s and except for the short break after retirement, I'd always been fascinated by software. In order to get added to Robb's site, <a href='https://obsidian.amerpie.lol/'>I had to start a blog</a>. I signed up at <a href='http://micro.blog/'>Micro.blog</a>, registered a domain and started writing. One app I saw mentioned over and over that I'd never used was Obsidian. It's free to download, and you can use it all you want without paying a dime unless you want to take advantage of their sync service, something I did a little later.</p>\n<p>I documented my learning process in Obsidian as it progressed. I'd download a plugin, watch a YouTube video, configure my setup, use it for a few days and then <a href='https://amerpie.lol/2024/03/06/my-dataview-use.html'>write a post for my blog</a>. I'd cross post it on Reddit and use a hashtag on Mastodon. I went for months living and breathing Obsidian. I started doing all my writing in it. I pimped out <a href='https://amerpie.lol/2024/03/29/my-daily-note.html'>the template for my daily note</a>, incorporating more and more of my life into it. I <a href='https://amerpie.lol/2024/02/04/how-to-send.html'>integrated key email messages</a> via IFTTT, Dropbox and Hazel. I <a href='https://amerpie.lol/2024/03/17/my-bookmark-workflow.html'>synced my bookmarks</a> from Raindrop.io. I started using Omnivore as my read it later service simply because <a href='https://amerpie.lol/2024/01/27/the-omnivore-to.html'>it automatically imports into Obsidian</a>. I started <a href='https://github.com/cyclelou/Amerpie'>my first GitHub repository</a> to share 500 Markdown notes containing my quotes collection. I managed to get Obsidian to do every single thing I'd once used Evernote for.</p>\n<p>Because of Obsidian, I've been able to learn to blog in the 21st century. I have four different blogs on three different platforms. I've got good notes and records and tens of thousands of words of web posts in my vault. Although I still write about the app occasionally, I've moved on to <a href='https://apps.louplummer.lol/'>writing reviews of other software</a> and even into <a href='https://louplummer.lol/'>non-technical writing</a>. It's amazing that something as simple as a plain text editor at its core has been at the center of my tech and real-life revival. It is so powerful and so extensible that it almost defies belief. The community around the app is generally helpful, supportive, curious and open. I've even interacted with the CEO of the company on social media.</p>\n<p>So, to the folks in whatever Bat Cave Obsidian is developed in, thank you for making such a wonderful tool. I owe you one.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

I did not limit myself to just the comics. I thought Dear Abby was fascinating and I always read the headlines on the front page. In North Carolina in the 1970s an infamous civil rights case was often featured. The Wilmington 10 was the name given to eight high school students, a minister from the United Church of Christ and an anti-poverty worker who had been caught up when the men were arrested for arson, following a bombing during racial unrest in the coastal town of Wilmington. The case was considered by many to be a travesty of justice from the very beginning. The convictions were based on eyewitness testimony from a mentally ill man who recanted during cross-examination and was banished from the courtroom. The other witness was given a motorcycle for his testimony. He too, later recanted.</p>\n<p>when the Soviet Union was accused by the United States of human rights violations, the Soviets used the Wilmington 10 as an example of American hypocrisy. After serving nearly a decade in prison, all of the convictions were overturned, and the state declined to re-prosecute. In 2013, over 40 years after their initial convictions, the Wilmington 10 were granted pardons by the governor of North Carolina, although four of them had already passed away. The oldest of them, the Reverend Benjamin Chavis, went on after his incarceration to become the national president of the NAACP.</p>\n<p><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmington_Ten?wprov=sfti1#Appeals'>The Wilmington 10 - Wikipedia</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/wilmingtonten.aspx'>The Wilmington 10 - University of Michigan Law School</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://youtu.be/fzOEAeJg2U8'>Democracy Now - YouTube</a><BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

Whoever covers the most distance in that time period will be declared the winner. Those completing 50k, 50 miles, 100k, 75 miles, and 100 miles will receive special awards. Some races are entrepreneurial money-making events for the organizers. Ironman, the titular sponsor of triathlons, is a for-profit company. The race Wonder Woman is in is a fundraiser. The money raised goes to an organization in the greater Williamsburg, VA area called The Arc. This is a wonderful inclusive organization offering programs to adults with developmental and intellectual disabilities.</p>\n<p>The name of the race is The Greensprings 24. The start/finish line and crew area (I'm crew) is at Jamestown High School. If you want to follow her, you can do it <a href='https://my.raceresult.com/314559/'>here.</a> Her race number is 204, and her actual name is Carol Plummer.</p>\n<p>I'll be set up in a pop-up off to the side with her supplies. I'll be in charge of filling bottles with both water and a liquid nutrition product called Tailwind. She has prepared packets of sports nutrition products that she will pick up every five laps or so. I have a small backpacking stove to heat up some real food for her to wolf down later in the day and through the night. It consists of things like plain white potatoes and soup. I'll be making coffee for us both.</p>\n<p>Today has been kind of ritualistic. We live about four hours away, so we had to travel and check into a hotel. She's stayed off her feet for the most part, although I did have to talk her out of going out and doing tourist things today. She has a more restless nature than I do! It's important that she stays extra hydrated today and that she eats some extra carbs. Her favorite pre-ultramarathon meal is pho, the Vietnamese rice noodle soup made with a salty and savory beef broth. She got into bed at 5:30 to read and hopefully doze off early. We will sleep as late as we can tomorrow before driving the 15 minutes to the racecourse in time to get the crew area set up.</p>\n<p>My duties will be pretty minimal. I'm mostly there as a cheerleader and motivator. If she gets blisters, I'll play medic, and as she gets progressively more tired, I'll help her with socks and shoe changes. I'll probably get yelled at a time or two. Ultramarathon runners are known for being grouchy crybabies sometimes because it's a terribly stressful sport. I'm experienced enough to let the abuse roll off. If blowing up at me makes her feel better, she's welcome to call me names any time. I admire her not just for competing in these events but also for all the training and disciplined training, eating, and sleeping she does on top of working an important job full-time, being a wife, a mom, and a grandmother. I don't call her Wonder Woman for nothing!</p>\n<p>When the race is over, we will have to pack the car and drive back to the hotel. We've arranged a late checkout so we can both get some sleep before driving home and going back to work on Monday.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

Over the next 15 years my cohort, smaller than the one that preceded it and the one that followed it (Millenials), began to reap the meager rewards our parents bequeathed us, single-parent families, careers as latch-key kids, run away inflation and coming of age with Reagan in the White House making it easy on rich folks and kicking off the decline of the middle class by breaking unions and kicking income inequality into high gear.</p>\n<p>The oldest Gen X-ers are only five years from retirement. Everything seems to have changed for us. We bought records we traded in for tapes that we traded in for CDs before we downloaded MP3s that we stopped listening to when we had to start paying a subscription fee to listen to music. After graduating from high school, I supported a wife and a baby by cooking at a Shoney's and serving in the National Guard one weekend a month. By the time my youngest reached maturity, two adults working full time at entry level jobs could barely make ends meet.</p>\n<p>We experienced a few cool things, like getting to watch MTV when they played music video. We've had some great music. We got to transition out of a world that worried about nuclear holocausts. Unfortunately we got to see AIDS put in an end to the free love we thought we were going to get. I've lost count of the financial crises we've endured.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/linkage/download-4.webp\" alt=\"download-4\" /></p>\n<p><a href='https://www.britannica.com/topic/Generation-X'>Generation X | Origin, Years, Characteristics, & Facts | Britannica</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/10/19/generation-x-retirement-denial/75731069007/'>Gen X is next up for retirement.

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/p070wbmx-resized.webp\" alt=\"The Night Watch\" /></p>\n<p>Back in the days when people still bought encyclopedias, my parents were confronted by an especially good salesman who sold them not only a full set of the Book of Knowledge but also a collection of classic literature. When I was in elementary school, I tackled many of those books because I thought they sounded interesting. I mean, Gulliver's Travels was about little people, and Pilgrim's Progress was about (I thought) American pioneers. I plowed through the books with as much understanding as I could muster at that age, and can today truly state that I've read them. The problem is that it's been years since I felt any urge to approach that kind of book. When I see people reading The Scarlet Letter or Dante, I'm in awe. I would feel like I was back in high school senior English if I picked up one of those books. I'm even inherently suspicious when an enthusiastic reviewer claims that a novel in one of the genres I like these days—English detective novels, science fiction, military fiction—rises to the level of literature.</p>\n<p>I'm generally OK with my lack of formal education. I managed to learn enough on my own to support myself through retirement. I can talk to anybody and don't suffer from low self-esteem (quite the opposite if you ask Wonder Woman). I just regret not being exposed to classes like music appreciation and art appreciation. I enjoy some classical music. I've listened to Vivaldi enough that I can generally recognize his compositions, but I don't have any background in theory. Opera is a mystery, and I've only got a rudimentary knowledge of the development of jazz, although I do have a good collection of Miles Davis and John Coltrane.</p>\n<p>When it comes to art, well, I've been to one exhibition—Norman Rockwell. I thoroughly enjoyed it, but I know that hardly qualifies me as a connoisseur. I can name famous artists and tell a Rothko from a Jackson Pollock, but I still feel under-qualified. My son takes trips to Boston and New York just to visit art museums. Considerable space in his tiny Austin bungalow is given over to his collection of art books, and the walls are covered in originals he's purchased at galleries. My walls are covered in pictures of my grandkids and Wonder Woman's photography, which is admittedly pretty arty.</p>\n<p>I rarely like any film that wins the Best Picture award from the Academy. In fact, I am still mad at myself for sitting through The English Patient all those years ago. It's not that I'm a fan of superhero movies—not that there is anything wrong with them—I just seem to lack the gene that lets people discern symbolism in films. I'm very much an on-the-surface kind of guy. My most common reaction to reviews of arty movies is WTF?</p>\n<p>At this point in my life, I'm not likely to summon the energy to improve on any of this. I've learned to live with my shortcomings in appreciating things the way the more cultured folks do. I feel proud of myself for reading the occasional book of poetry (full disclosure: my son buys them for me) and for reading The New Yorker, Harper's, and The Atlantic. That will have to do, I suppose.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/leroy.webp\" alt=\"leroy\" /></p>\n<p>For one reason or another, I've taken some kind of medication on a daily basis for almost forty years. I am an expert at swallowing pills. I'd hate to estimate how many I've taken over the years. Despite the attempts by my insurance company to strong-arm me into using a mail-order pharmacy, I stubbornly cling to a locally owned one that I lucked into by being hard to get along with.</p>\n<p>I used to use various big box pharmacies. One thing I quickly learned by doing that was that the people there do not care about you. You might occasionally run into someone with a heart for people, but by and large, the pharmacists and techs there don't form relationships, and they stop seeing their customers as human beings after a while. That's been my experience. They will tell you to come back tomorrow in a minute. They will tell you that counting your own meds after they short you is your responsibility. Furthermore, they won't make the extra effort to deal with frustrating insurance companies. I pretty much would rather die a thousand deaths than deal with one.</p>\n<p>Luckily, a local pharmacist with good business sense saw an opportunity to draw business away from them by starting his own pharmacy in a good location. He hired nice, competent people, and most of the time, you could go in there with a prescription in hand and walk out within 15 minutes with your medicine. It was glorious. Unfortunately, he had two giant TVs right behind the cash register tuned in at all times to Fox News. I was in there when they were covering a story about poor people trapped in a flood after a hurricane. The owner of the pharmacy was ranting that it was all their own fault for not leaving. I disgustedly asked him if he thought maybe they should have just driven their Maserati out of town or something.</p>\n<p>I went home, went to the pharmacy's Facebook page, and left a scathing review, where I said they had good service but bad politics, and they weren't getting any more of my money as a result. I resigned myself to living in Big Box Hell. Some period after that, I got a message through Facebook from a name I didn't recognize. The writer, first name LeRoy, told me that he'd been a partner in the pharmacy but that he was leaving to go out on his own. He let me know that there would be no giant TVs playing Fox News in his new business and asked me to give him a chance, so I did.</p>\n<p>These days, when I go to a doctor's visit for med refills, LeRoy has them filled before I can get out of the parking lot. If I have a question or an issue about one of my prescriptions, I can message him via Facebook or text him to get an answer or a refill. He's fought every insurance battle that's faced me for a decade. When big pharma jacked up the price of one of my meds by 400%, LeRoy figured out how to get me a better price. If I'm late picking up a refill, he doesn't put my meds back on the shelf and yell at me on my next visit; he just holds on to them for me, secure in the knowledge that I will get there eventually.</p>\n<p>We are social media friends, and both of us are big baseball fans. I've followed his son's career from club ball through our local high school and summer ball. He now plays for the university where I work, which has one of the nation's best NCAA D3 baseball programs and a legendary coach. LeRoy's wife is a nurse practitioner with her own clinic, and she's treated me for everything from multi-day hiccups to a sliced finger.</p>\n<p>In a day and age where so many businesses seem as though they exist only to extract money from you, LeRoy and his pharmacy are a total exception. He gives unfailingly polite service and always makes me feel welcome and cared for. He inquires about my wife, asks about my job, and tells me about his last baseball trip. Everyone should be so lucky.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

I like chicken sandwiches OK, but I prefer the ones from Bojangles. Hell, I eat the ones they sell in gas stations. Every Chick-fil-A I come across is always super crowded. They have a reputation for dealing well with crowds, but you have to go be part of a crowd to find out if that's true. No thanks.</p>\n<p>The biggest reason I don't eat there though is their reputation for being homophobic. Someone in my area had a Chik-fil-A Support Day a couple of years ago and lots of ostentatious Christians that I know made a big deal out of going their and posting it on social media just in case they hadn't done enough in their lives to be shitty to  LGBT people.</p>\n<p>In doing some basic research for this post, I found that the hate-chicken people quit giving money to homophobic organizations a few years ago. The owner doesn't even use his personal fortune that way any more. Most people think the motivation behind that is to stave off boycotts and bad press and they are probably right. Right-wing organizations accused Chik-fil-A of caving the the Gay Agenda, if you can believe that.</p>\n<p>I know some principled leftists who patronize them now, partially because out of all the fast food chains, they offer more for people with celiacs.

You could use HTML to dress up what you wrote, so there was a small but satisfying thrill in learning how to be good at that. As usual, they had an off-topic category too, where you could write about whatever you wanted, and I contributed there all the time. People could follow you and send you private messages. I eventually outgrew it, but I tried to find a guy from there recently, after 27 years, and I succeeded because he's still using the same unique username.</p>\n<p>When I had a Geocities website, part of it was dedicated to Vietnam veterans and their kids. I corresponded with quite a few men and women who were eager to have someone to talk with about their experiences. I live near a giant army base, so all the vets I know have comrades-in-arms everywhere they go, but the 18-year-old who got drafted from Iowa in 1967 and did his year in hell didn't always have that, and I was glad to hear them out, publish their stories, and generally just be as supportive as I could.</p>\n<p>I was in some great bicycling forums around the turn of the century, one of which still sends me birthday greetings every year. I went as far as Georgia to meet folks from there for an organized ride.</p>\n<p>For a few years, believe it or not, I took part in the local newspaper's community forum, which was mostly a cesspool of name-calling and ad hominem attacks on liberals. I'd write outrageously provocative stuff about W. Bush and his wars just to stir up the flag wavers. They doxed me regularly, and the woman I was married to absolutely hated me going on there. After a while, it wasn't fun anymore, so I stopped.</p>\n<p>When I hiked the Appalachian Trail, I kept <a href='http://www.trailjournals.com/leftyandhush/'>an online journal</a> every single day and posted to a website called Trail Journals. As a result, I had people up and down the East Coast who wrote to us and visited us on the trail. It wasn't unusual to meet trail groupies who knew all kinds of our fellow hikers from reading their journals. More than a decade later, I am still in touch with people I first met through that journal.</p>\n<p>Then we enter the long dark winter of the soul—Facebook was all there was. I never really used Twitter for anything other than news, so I didn't find much social about it. <a href='https://louplummer.lol/why-im-still-on-facebook/'>My Facebook experience is much the same as many folks</a>. In 2008, it was a place to keep up with friends and family and to reconnect with people from the past. Today, it's the same toxic hellscape for me as it is for everyone else. I mostly stay there to see pictures of my grandkids. In 2017, I had a viral post that caused me to get literally thousands of friend requests, many of which I accepted for the hell of it. I met plenty of cool people, including a friend I eventually met in Derry, Northern Ireland.</p>\n<p>My experience on the IndieWeb since I joined <a href='https://amerpie.lol'>micro.blog</a> in January has been my favorite experience out of all of them. In 10 months, I've posted more on <a href='https://social.lol/@amerpie'>Mastodon</a> than I did on Twitter in 15 years. I have three accounts on different servers. I closed my Twitter account too, not wanting to send any traffic to what is essentially the Nazi Bar of the Internet. I am a happy customer of <a href='https://linkage.lol/omglol-is-the-best-thing-on-the-internet/'>OMG.LOL</a>, <a href='https://patreon.com/500social'>500.social</a>, and <a href='https://onephoto.club'>Onephoto.club</a>. Aside from Micro.blog, I also use <a href='https://scribbles.page'>Scribbles</a> and <a href='https://bearblog.dev/'>BearBlog.</a></p>\n<p>I have accounts on Instagram, Threads, BlueSky, Pinterest, Nostr, Pixelfed, Farcaster, and Tumblr, but I use them mostly to syndicate what I write on my blogs.</p>\n<p>I do love Reddit, where I've <a href='https://www.reddit.com/user/amerpie/'>had an account for nearly 19 years</a>, despite its checkered past. Syndicating <a href='https://apps.louplummer.lol'>AppAddict</a> there has driven lots of traffic to my website. Earlier this year, I volunteered to become a moderator of <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/'>r/macOS</a>, a subreddit with over 300K members. That's been interesting. I get a chance to help out newbies and to stamp out some toxicity, so what it lacks in actual fun, it makes up in satisfaction.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

This can be\nproblematic during your work day if you need the full system resources\nof your computer, but it has decided to start copying a bunch of files\nto your backup. The venerable utility, Time Machine Editor, a free app\nby developer Thomas Clement is the solution to this problem. To use TME,\nyou first need to go into Time Machine options in System Settings and\nset your backups to &quot;Manually.&quot; Download and install TME from <a\nhref=\"https://tclementdev.com/timemachineeditor/\">the developers&#39;s\nwebsite</a> or through Homebrew.</p>\n\n<pre>brew install --cask timemachineeditor</pre>\n\n<p>Once installed, you can choose any of several options to schedule Time\nMachine backups. On my work iMac, I chose to stop the backups between\n8am and 5pm when I am using the computer but to continue hourly backups\nafter that. To be on the safe side, TME allows you to create local disk\nsnapshots during the time you are not writing to your backup disk. They\nare very fast to make, and provide additional restoration points. Since\nthey are local, they do not protect against a disk crash but can be\nuseful if the machine goes away from the backup disk for a while.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve used this utility for more than a decade, and it&#39;s never let me\ndown.</p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Good Old Time Machine Editor - A Useful Free Utility' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

Although I am partial to the mountains, there is something to be said for visiting the colonial historical sites closer to the coast. Whether it's Jamestown, one of the first settlements in the new world, Yorktown, site of the American victory in the Revolutionary War or the extensive and richly restored town of Colonial Williamsburg, you won't be disappointed. Thankfully, the exhibits in Williamsburg include ones dedicated to Native American and African American history. It's quite an experience to walk the streets and see people in colonial dress, gardening with period tools and making the same type of crafts that were common in the 1700s. It's a fun and affordable way to spend  a day.  If you are a cyclist, bring your bike. The 23-mile Colonial Parkway between Yorktown and Jamestown is a road you'll want to add to the miles you've traveled while pedaling.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.colonialwilliamsburg.org/learn/about-colonial-williamsburg/history/'>History of Colonial Williamsburg</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://www.nps.gov/colo/parkway.htm'>Colonial Parkway - Colonial National Historical Park (U.S. National Park Service)</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://historicjamestowne.org/visit/plan-your-visit/'>Plan Your Visit | Historic Jamestowne</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://www.nps.gov/york/planyourvisit/index.htm'>Plan Your Visit - Yorktown Battlefield Part of Colonial National Historical Park (U.S. National Park Service)</a>\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/bbdb8f67-6ccc-4fd1-9155-b1969c01577a_1_105_c.webp\" alt=\"Maine Lobster\" /></p>\n<p>The year Wonder Woman and I hiked the Appalachian Trail, we were away from home for 156 days, from early May to mid-October. At the beginning of our journey, I weighed around 230 pounds. By the end, I had dropped to 180 pounds and was wearing medium-sized clothes for the first time since high school. For most long-distance hikers, the two overriding feelings are ravenous hunger and fatigue. The trail involves over 400,000 feet of climbing, stretching from Maine to Georgia and covering just shy of 2,200 miles. It’s almost impossible for hikers to carry enough food to sustain their weight, though some manage better than others for physiological reasons I can’t quite grasp.</p>\n<p>In preparation for our hike, we spent a lot of time packing boxes of food for my daughter and son-in-law to mail to us at various hostels, outfitters, and general delivery post offices along the way. We bought cases of oatmeal, Pop-Tarts, energy bars, corn chips, and other pre-made food. We also dehydrated large quantities of sweet potatoes, black beans, and several London broils to make beef jerky. Since Wonder Woman has celiac disease and can’t eat wheat, we were concerned about finding adequate food for her along the trail. In hindsight, we shouldn’t have worried—or prepared so much food. We ended up giving away large portions of it when it became monotonous. To our surprise, finding gluten-free food wasn’t as challenging as we had anticipated.</p>\n<p>A guy my size, carrying a 25-pound backpack and climbing mountains all day in hot weather, can burn upwards of 5,000 calories a day if he hikes long enough. We typically woke up around 5:00 AM to eat and pack our gear. My breakfast usually consisted of two large honeybuns thickly covered with peanut butter or Nutella. Occasionally, I’d indulge in a bagel. I drank instant coffee boiled over the beer can alcohol stove I packed. While hiking, I’d consume a Snickers bar or a couple of Nature Valley granola bars every hour. I also ate quite a few Clif bars, but I found they tasted progressively worse the more I had.</p>\n<p>For lunch and dinner, I often wrapped my meals in a big flour tortilla. My fillings included tuna, cheese from a block I carried, dried beef or Slim Jims, hot sauce, and maybe some crumbled Fritos. I always had a second tortilla with peanut butter. For dessert, I enjoyed candy, usually Whoppers or dark chocolate. I also devoured countless bags of pork rinds—they weigh almost nothing and pack a whopping 900 calories per bag. Sometimes I’d eat a couple of family packs of instant mashed potatoes or instant rice or pasta dishes from Lipton. I’m proud to say that, unlike most of my fellow hikers, I didn’t eat any ramen noodles. I like them just fine, but they simply didn’t appeal to me at the time. After returning home, I discovered that I had royally messed up my electrolyte balance by not getting enough sodium, so maybe some ramen would have been a good idea after all.</p>\n<p>Hiker hunger is truly on display at restaurants in the towns along the trail. Every few days, hikers need to find a place to buy supplies, wash their clothes, and grab a shower. However, they don’t do any of that until they’ve filled their bellies at whatever establishment they can find. There were times when I’d order a meal, quickly finish it, and then order a second meal before feeling even slightly full.\nAlongside the food, I’d drink entire pitchers of Coke, or, when we were in the South, sweet iced tea. We were always on the lookout for any AYCE (all you can eat) places, although I was asked to leave a Chinese buffet in Pittsfield, MA, after my sixth plate. In New Jersey, there’s a stretch of trail that allows you to hit quite a few delis in a short span, and I certainly took advantage of that. In New England, I savored a delicacy we don’t have in North Carolina: gigantic full-belly clams. Of course, in Maine, I enjoyed fresh lobster during a memorable meal in Millinocket, the town near the northern terminus of Mount Katahdin.</p>\n<p>Most of the weight I lost came back within a year. To this day, I haven’t had another Snickers bar, and I went a decade without eating a honeybun. I’m not a Nutella fan anymore, although I still enjoy a fair amount of peanut butter. Whenever we travel to trail towns during hiking season, I always nudge Wonder Woman if I see a hiker come in, so we can watch them order the prodigious amount of food they typically get. It brings back such fond memories.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

The ad blocker that I use, <a href='https://ublockorigin.com/'>Ublock Origin,</a> is in danger of being neutered by Microsoft, the company that makes my browser, Edge, which I use for some <a href='https://amerpie.lol/2024/01/09/microsoft-edge-really.html'>very specific reasons</a>. If you use Google Chrome (and most of you do), your ad-blocking capabilities have been seriously dampened by Google's decision to implement new standards for browser extensions. Don't panic though. There is a solution that is free and will make your computer more private and your browsing faster. That solution is NextDNS, a free service that blocks ads and malware from ever loading on your computer in the first place. If you set this up, you can even stop whole domains from ever loading. Imagine having Twitter never polluting your presence ever again. Not only that, but you can be protected from all kids of Internet bad guys, like those who use domain name typos to trick you, or from known bad actors, over 100,000 known domains are blocked by default.</p>\n<p>You con't have to be super technical to get this set up. There is plenty of documentation and help available. Go sign up today!</p>\n<p><a href='https://nextdns.io/'>NextDNS - The new firewall for the modern Internet</a></p>\n<BR>\n<BR>[Enjoyed it?

On the first day, we set a record for voter turnout. Even in the western portions of the state where a recent hurricane destroyed roads and where many people still don't have power, the number of people who turned out exceeded the numbers from four years ago when conditions were not impeded. Wonder Woman and I always try to vote early, partly to get it out of the way and partly out of excitement.</p>\n<p>This year we went to a recreation center located about three miles from our house. My kids went to dances there when they were in school, and I have taken my grandchildren there many times to play on the playground. Today I went to defend democracy from the fascists trying to take over my country. Donald Trump recently called people like me \"radical left lunatics\" and said we are \"the enemy within.\"</p>\n<p>We were met by campaign volunteers from various candidates, who are allowed to approach voters as long as they stay 50 feet or more from the front doors. I gratefully accepted a voter guide from a guy who had a list of all the Democratic candidates and offered polite \"no, thank yous\" to everyone else who wanted to hand me literature. I usually try to research all the obscure races ahead of time, but I was glad to have the guide nonetheless. We used to be able to do straight party voting here, but the Republicans eliminated it because they thought it would help them.</p>\n<p>Most of the people in line were younger and there were lots of POC. One dumb ass showed up in full Trump rally regalia and people were staring daggers at him. I wanted to catch his eye and mouth \"I'm canceling your vote\" but he kept staring at the floor, too embarrassed, I hope to feel like he could hold his head up amongst his perceived enemies. In my mind, whenever I am in line to vote, the happy people are always Democrats and the sour pusses are Republicans. Unfortunately, 60% of white men are probably going to vote for Trump, citing many different reasons but the primary one, I am convinced is to perpetuate white supremacy. Yeah, screw that. Not this white guy.</p>\n<p>We had one extremely stupid constitutional amendment to vote on, one that would make excluding everyone under the age of 18 who isn't a US citizen from voting. If you thought there was already a law in place that did that, you would be right, but you underestimate the idiocy of the Republican Party who wants to plant the idea in their pitiful voter's heads that the Democrats are getting ready to allow children and illegal immigrants to cancel Bubba's vote. These people are pitiful.</p>\n<p>I will be glad when the election is settled. I expect there to be all kinds of controversy and dirty tricks from the other side. Another insurrection is certainly a possibility. They are losers but they don't lose gracefully.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

I run a Time Machine backup and I make regular <a\nhref=\"https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/superduper-disk-cloner\">SuperDuper</a>\nfull disk clones. For offsite data storage, I recently discovered <a\nhref=\"https://duplicati.com/\">Duplicati</a>, a free, open-source backup\nprogram that uses encryption to securely store your data on various\ncloud services, local drives, or remote servers. It offers flexible\nscheduling, versioning, and incremental backups for reliable data\nprotection.</p>\n\n<p>The free plan covers up to five computers. I downloaded and installed\nthe client. It launches a web interface that walks you through setting\nup you first backup. To test it, I elected to create a backup of my\nObsidian vault using my free Dropbox account as the file storage\ndestination. I elected to back the files up every 24 hours and it has\nbeen running every day at exactly the time I selected. </p>\n\n<p>Duplicati also works with Google Drive, One Drive and Box as well as\nAzure Blob and Amazon S3. It works with Windows machines too, in case\nyou want to add one of those to your free account. Be default is uses\nAES-256 encryption standard, but you can choose PGP encryption as an\noption.</p>\n\n<p>The free plan includes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Monitor backups from anywhere</li>\n<li>Secure credential storage (planned)</li>\n<li>Insights dashboard</li>\n<li>Monitor up to 5 machines</li>\n<li>View the last 200 backups</li>\n<li>1 year monitoring retention</li>\n<li>Community support</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Duplicati - Free Encrypted Offsite Backup for Your Mac' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/stereotype1.webp\" alt=\"stereotype1\" /></p>\n<p>I'm not going to pretend that I don't make assumptions about people from time to time because, as much as I try not to, I fall into the trap occasionally. I'm glad that, for the most part, plenty of other people and I seem to be less inclined to do it these days. We are learning not to assume that when someone is married, it's necessarily to someone of the opposite sex. We aren't as surprised when we find out that our friend's new love interest is from a different race. I love meeting someone who is into technology as much as I am who doesn't play video games, so I don't feel like such an outsider.</p>\n<p>At the university where I work, the Dean of the College of Arts, Humanities & Sciences, who is a Professor of Religion & Philosophy, is covered in tattoos. The university chief of staff, a diminutive ex-banker, swears like a sailor. The football coach, who looks for all the world like a defensive tackle, turns out to have been a record-setting quarterback in college. The best network engineer I ever worked with talks with an accent that would fit right in \"The Dukes of Hazzard\" or \"Hee-Haw.\"</p>\n<p>People from other regions of the country (or the world) can easily have stereotypes of those of us from the South here in the US. That stereotype is that we are conservative, a little (or a lot) racist, old-fashioned, and uneducated. I always feel that I need to establish my progressive bona fides quickly, especially if someone knows I'm also a veteran or that I worked in manufacturing. I have to do that for my fellow Southerners too, just to keep the ones who actually are conservative racists from trying to include me in their conversations. I am not the type to ever hide a single facet of my personality or beliefs from anyone. I want people to know exactly who and what they are dealing with.</p>\n<p>It seems to be a driving force within conservatism to work towards putting people back into stereotypical roles. Organizations that have used DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) are routinely attacked by Republicans, who paint the whole idea as a disturbance to the natural order of the world. They want women and people of color to stay in their traditional places. They make no secret of their disdain for same-sex marriage. When they try to practice inclusion, they use unqualified bootlickers like Herschel Walker or Mark Robinson or someone with the flawed party loyalty of Nikki Haley.</p>\n<p>Learning how to escape thinking in stereotypes can be a lifelong process. Some people seem to naturally escape those kinds of attitudes, while others, like me, have had to be deprogrammed throughout our lives. I'm sure I have a long way to go, but I'm happy with how far I have come. Being open-minded is the goal.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

The pharmacy used to put my medicine back on the shelf until they learned my patterns. I told Wonder Woman that I was going to buy a new pair of shoes for about a year before I actually ordered them. It's not that I am lazy; I do plenty. It's just that I need A LOT of time to think about doing things before actually doing them. I don't know why the prospect of seeing something that needs to be done and then actually doing it is repugnant to me, but it is.</p>\n<p>I have collected quotes for years. I have a number of applications to keep them, plus a plain text <a href='https://github.com/cyclelou/Amerpie'>repository that I maintain on GitHub.</a> I'm super diligent about identifying quotes I want to save, copying them to a specific workspace in an app I use, and making sure I've got all the pertinent metadata: author, source, etc. And that's where the process gets bogged down. I may wait until I have 40 or 50 quotes saved up before I sit down and make myself catalog and tag them and file them in the various places where I like to keep them for reference. For a while, I tried to make doing that a part of my nightly checklist, but that habit did not stick.</p>\n<p>There are other computer-related chores that I put off. I have all the emails from Netflix, Hulu, Max, etc. filtered into a specific mailbox so that I can go through them all at one time and add shows and movies that look promising to our playlists. I have an app, <a href='https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/sequel-entertainment-database'>Sequel</a>, that consolidates the playlists, so I don't even have to go to multiple websites to add them. I even have a recurring task set up in my to-do app to remind me to do this every Sunday, typically the slowest day of the week. Yeah, I am about three months behind.</p>\n<p>We have a spare bedroom where I usually take naps on off days. The cheap bed frame I ordered from Amazon literally came apart, as in it separated into pieces. I was still napping away on the mattress and putting up with the crazy tilt and weird lumps. Wonder Woman found out about it, and BOOM, instantly fixed. She is a procrastination enabler.</p>\n<p>Some things can't be put off, obviously. One of my jobs is preparing dinner for us. She is perpetually hungry because her ultramarathon training burns a lot of calories, and she needs to keep her energy levels up. I learned a long time ago that delaying meal times was a non-starter in our house. All I need is a hangry super heroine coming at me looking for a meal!</p>\n<p>I'm also pretty disciplined about my blogging. I am currently riding a 204-day streak of posting every day. If I know I'm going to have a busy night, I try to knock something out in the morning before work or at lunch, although sometimes I just have to stay up late. When it comes to habits, I am always better off if I do them 100% regularly. The last time I meditated with discipline, I managed a 365-day streak, and my Apple Watch rings record is a consecutive 617 days without missing one. All this is balanced by streaks I have for putting things off, like replacing my deck, which I have now successfully stalled for two-plus years.</p>\n<p>I don't think this makes me a terrible person. At least, I hope it doesn't. One day I might have to do something about it. .<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

				"title": "My Letter to a Homophobic Friend",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/gsa-less-than250.webp\" alt=\"gsa-less-than250\" /></p>\n<p>I'm a digital pack rat who enjoys browsing through decades-old emails and blog posts from the 90s when I was on GeoCities. I recently found a letter I wrote to a homophobic friend in 1997, where I tried to disabuse him of some backward notions and challenge some of his beliefs. I won't reprint the whole thing because parts of it are cringeworthy, and I use language in it that wouldn't fly today. However, I am glad to see that most of what I believed 27 years ago, I still believe today.</p>\n<p>My friend was unhappy that the use of the word \"homophobia\" was becoming common. He said no one was afraid of gay people and that there was no fear involved. My response dipped into armchair psychology mode, but in hindsight, I still see it as a valid argument.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is a fear of homosexuals in our society. I believe almost everyone has, at some point, either had some sort of homosexual experience (rarely) or had a homosexual fantasy (commonly). This act or thought provokes such shame and guilt in some people, usually men, that a strong aversion occurs—one that is so psychologically entwined with self-identity that an overemphasis occurs in denying or rejecting the act or thought. We all know men who are so insecure they can't carry their wife's purse for her, buy her tampons, or admit that Tom Cruise is handsome. Why? Because someone might think they are gay, and since they once had a homosexual fantasy, they might be gay. So they better tell some [gay] jokes, buy themselves a four-wheel-drive pickup, a shotgun, and a Pit Bull, and put that rumor to rest right now.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>His other complaint was that the \"homosexual agenda\" was being pushed and promoted. I think the people doing the promotion were \"the liberals\" and \"the media.\" This was during the Clinton administration, when the culture wars were just getting started, but the flames of it were already burning brightly.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Since I live in North Carolina, prime Bible Belt country, I don't get to see this homosexual promotion everyone is talking about. In fact, I see the opposite. People may not use the N-word much anymore, but calling someone the other F-word happens all the time. Some of the gay people I know are ridiculed, shunned, and ostracized. I've never known a gay recruiter sent by the National Gay Headquarters to a lonely post in my town to convert school children to the cause. I do know my company doesn't fire openly gay employees as it did ten years ago, but I also know people who don't feel sorry for AIDS victims. Logic tells me that no one chooses to be gay any more than you choose to be straight. Who would pick a lifestyle that offers the possibility of harassment, discrimination, the loss of family ties, and the small chance of ever being a parent?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thankfully, some of my arguments seem simplistic today. Maybe they are even regarded as common sense. As a straight guy with the privilege that entails, I have the luxury of only thinking about the subject when I feel like it or when I see some backward behavior. Unfortunately, the right wing has chosen to ramp up its attacks with things like banning books about LGBT issues and making Tim Walz's sponsorship of the Gay/Straight Alliance at the high school where he taught into an issue.</p>\n<p>Since I wrote that letter, some positive things have happened in American society. Same-sex marriage was legalized, and lots of people now know same-sex couples. Contrary to the fearmongering by conservatives, none of us straight folks had to get divorced, nor is it now legal to marry your pet. You can also be gay and out in the military without jeopardizing your career. Last time I checked, the US wasn't threatened by another country due to the weak state of the Army and Marines. I'm glad both of those things have happened, and I hope that an inevitable future conservative win in an election doesn't undermine them.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

Football coaches and motivational speakers may beg to differ, but they have a vested interest in making people think that they can always just try harder to achieve success by whatever definition is popular that day. I don't buy it. I believe that people want to succeed. They want to be good parents, good employees, good spouses. Hell, they just want to be good. In the real world though we are faced with all kinds of mundane challenges, from differing energy levels, differing states of mental clarity and motivational levels that rise and fall on a sea of different inputs.</p>\n<p>I'm not advocating using this sentiment as a cop out for slacking. I'm advocating it as an explanation for the human condition. There are healthy methods of self-criticism, and then there are unhealthy feelings of low self-worth or guilt that serves no purpose. A certain amount of staring at one's own belly button is OK, but excessive bouts of obsessing over previous life choices is a self-centered exercise that serves little purpose. Learning how to be easy on yourself is the first step in extending that same level of acceptance to those you feel have let you down in life, whether it be your parents, former bosses or the bully in third grade.</p>\n<p>I started my parenting journey as an 18-year-old living in a trailer park making $4.25 an hour, riding a Sears bicycle to work. By the time my oldest left to join the Navy, I owned a home, a couple of cars and had a state job from which I retired. Today that kid (now 41) manages a team of 600 people, talks to me all the time and has a life that would make plenty of people envious. He turned out just fine. I made plenty of mistakes with my kids. I don't say that lightly at all. Of course, I wish I'd been better in the Dad game, but I know longer wallow in any kind of guilt. My love for them never wavered, and that is what's important.</p>\n<p>As a four times married recovering alcoholic with bipolar disorder, you better believed that I have regrets. I just don't have self-loathing. Life can be incredibly hard for the best equipped among us. Throw in a few handicaps and we all become miracles very quickly.</p>\n<p>Everyone has a story. Everyone has things in their life other people don't know about. You can't tell who is recovering from a family death, who suffers from chronic pain, or who is desperately searching for an antidepressant that actually works. Some people make a big deal about not being judgmental, but I don't buy it. Being judgmental is a survival skill. I make judgments all the time, but I try not to do it in a way that lets other people live rent-free in my head. In my line of work, I deal with people who don't like or understand technology. Some get frustrated easily and act out when their computer doesn't do what they want it to. I don't like being treated rudely, who does, but I understand where they are coming from. I just file them in the appropriate mental category and I move on, or at least I try.</p>\n<p>I don't pretend to love every one. I can't use \"they're doing the best they can\" to solve all my issues with the world. It doesn't help me understand or forgive Trump supporters, uncaring bosses or various flavors of mean people, but it definitely helps me deal with the people I care about.<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/oil.webp\" alt=\"Oil Well\" /></p>\n<p>Somehow, when I first investigated starting a blog, I managed to avoid the many websites devoted to creating a money-making machine <strong>USING THESE 10 SIMPLE TRICKS!!!</strong> The blogs I was familiar with weren't covered in ads, and I didn't have to pay to read them. There was an occasional invitation to buy the writer a coffee, but nothing high-pressure or gross.</p>\n<p>A couple of weeks ago, Keenan, the creator of A Very Good Blog, <a href='https://gkeenan.co/avgb/ive-missed-sam-for-a-very-long-time-or-pick-your-battles/'>wrote a long, heartfelt post</a> about his lifelong relationship with his much-loved cousin and how the American political divide affected their relationship. It's the kind of work that deserves to be included in an anthology and everyone's Best of 2024 collections. It wasn't surrounded by banner advertisements or cut off in the middle with a place for paying customers to log in. No, it was offered to the world as the work of art it most certainly is. Many people have now read it, shared it, cried over it, and been inspired by it. The ability to write like that is a gift Keenan shares with the world. The people who recognize the richness of the Indy Web, the small web, and the blogs that comprise it are the grateful beneficiaries of Keenan's largesse. They, I mean, we, are a community who share pieces of ourselves, of our lives with one another because we feel called to do it.</p>\n<p>I like to write, and of course, I want what I publish to be seen by as many people who might care to read it, but I don't want to approach what I have to share with a marketer's eye. My blogging style is mostly autobiographical and very personal. I write about my life, warts and all. I feel good when I finish a post. I'd never want to worry that I needed to appeal to this or that demographic or use certain keywords to make Google like me. I just want to tell stories, make people think, and be a part of the small group that rejects corporate algorithms in favor of honest engagement with an audience that isn't manipulated into viewing <a href='https://louplummer.lol/'>Living Out Loud</a>, <a href='https://louplummer.lol/'>Linkage</a>, or <a href='https://apps.louplummer.lol/'>AppAddict</a>.</p>\n<p>Since 1994 I've made a living by helping people with technology problems in one way or another. Luckily, my interest in computers hasn't been ruined by doing it for a living. But that's just it. I already have a profession I love. I have no more desire to pad my bank account by blogging than I do in finding a way to monetize my bicycle or my hiking boots. It's shameful that there's a movement in this country to have people monetize their hobbies when what we need is a movement to make sure working people earn enough from their jobs so that they can have meaningful lives away from work.</p>\n<p>I make no claims at artistry. I'm just a guy with a laptop and some spare time. I'm grateful to anyone who uses part of their precious minutes on this earth to read what I post. I'm not planning on stopping, and I don't think I'll ever be interested in taking money out of your pocket.\n<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/livingoutloud/paranoia-mike-king.webp\" alt=\"paranoia-mike-king\" /></p>\n<p>Being appropriately cautious is a survival skill. We have evolved to do things like sniff food before we eat it to make sure it isn't spoiled and to keep our guard up around strangers. A lot of human behavior is understandable in that context. I wouldn't consider myself reckless in any way. I drive cautiously enough. I haven't been in any kind of physical confrontation in decades.</p>\n<p>Certain cautious behavior is gender based and makes perfect sense. Like most men, I don't think about being the victim of sexual assault. Most people have individualized reasons for their comfort with risk. I get it.</p>\n<p>Having said all that, I'm still not cool with paranoia. There is a certain amount of risk inherent in being a functional adult and no one gets to escape from all of it. When I see a person who is so risk averse that they deprive themselves, or worse, they deprive others, it drives me nuts. I like computers and software. It's kind of my thing. I see many, many people who act terrified to install or use all kinds of software out of unfounded or unspecified fears. I'm not just talking about technologically ignorant people either. There are people in my industry who think that there is something or someone nefarious behind every new app. There are ways to investigate these issues and ways to mitigate risk. Quit being paranoid!</p>\n<p>In jobs I have had, I trust that my bosses have enough faith in me to make professional decisions when a new situation arises. It's a judgment call, of course. There are times when one needs to seek guidance. Most of the time, however, I have no problem making a call and moving forward to get a job done. If my decisions are questioned, I feel fairly confident that I can defend them. I am sure you have encountered people though who get paralyzed if they are faced with the unknown. They come to a dead stop and act as if they just know they will \"get in trouble\" if they do anything without running it by the boss first. I want to grab these people by the neck and shake them. Quit being paranoid you sorry excuse for an adult. Quit trying to evade all responsibility. Grow a pair.</p>\n<p>Then there are the people who are sure that the mysterious \"they\" are out there thwarting progress and holding back the common man. The people who blame \"them\" without ever trying to get to the bottom of who \"they\" might be are another category I'm pretty derisive about. There is no doubt that giant corporations do not have society's best interest at heart. Capitalism is not structured that way. Rather than railing against the unknown, however, learn to name and shame the people and organizations behind your oppression. Let that knowledge influence how you vote and where you spend your money. We have limited power as individuals, but we do have some, plus we have the power to organize and to take collective action. That's how slavery was ended, how women got the vote, how child labor was outlawed and how every labor protection in existence came into being. Quit being paranoid. Do something!</p>\n<p>If anything about this offends you, I do not apologize. Quit being paranoid!<BR>\n<BR><a href='#upvote-form'>Enjoyed it?

It would serve anyone interested in investigating software or trying new apps to learn a few things about how to answer this question for themselves. Here is a list that is not comprehensive but should serve as a good place to start.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Search Reddit for references to the app.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Apps from the Mac app store can generally be regarded as safe from malware, but you should read the privacy policy and make a decision based on your comfort level</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href='https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/cryptomator-free-and-open-source-cloud-encryption'>Use a firewall</a> like Little Snitch or Lulu if you have concerns about an app accessing the Internet with your data. Objective-See also makes Block-Block which will notify you when new apps try to access the Internet.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Don't use any pirated software</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Don't disable System Integrity Protection or Gatekeeper</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If downloading from third party sites like MacUpdate or GitHub, evaluate the number of downloads or stars an app has to determine how widely used it is. Generally (but not always) apps that have a lot of users have been investigated by enough people to be safe.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Stay current on tech/Apple news. If there is a misbehaving app, it generally makes the news.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If you want the extra protection, use something like Malware Bytes on demand scanner</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If you are dealing with highly sensitive financial or other data, learn how to use encryption tools like <a href='https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/cryptomator-free-and-open-source-cloud-encryption'>Cryptomator</a> so that you have control and you are not relying on unknown developers.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Learn to use a VPNs if you have security and privacy concerns.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Don't believe everything you hear. There are bad actors who <a href='https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/an-unemotional-look-at-clean-my-mac-x'>spread misinformation about safe apps.</a> Paranoia can also be catching.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href='https://codesigningstore.com/how-to-tell-a-download-is-safe'>How Can I Tell If a Download Is Safe?</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://www.wikihow.com/Know-when-It-Is-Safe-to-Download-Something'>11 Easy Ways to Know If It Is Safe to Download Something</a></p>\n<p>Agree?

The app switcher has a context menu for each app and supports\ndragging items to the icons to open them.</p>\n\n<p>As would be expected from a developer known for having exacting\npreferences in his workspace, you can fine tune almost every element in\nthe app. Switch Glass is $7.99 on the <a\nhref=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/switchglass/id1498546559?ls=1&amp;mt=12\">Mac\nApp Store.</a></p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Switch Glass - A Configurable Application Switcher with Per Display Settings' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

I&#39;ve been a\nKeyboard Maestro user for many years. I have over 800 macros within that\napplication and a lot of experience using it, but after working with\nKeysmith for just a short while, I have to admit it makes some actions\neasier to record and activate. It&#39;s not a replacement for Keyboard\nMaestro, but it will certainly supplement it.</p>\n\n<p>Keysmith detects buttons, lists, and page loads automatically. The first\nmacro I created with it was able to Open Obsidian, copy my daily note,\nopen Day One, create a new entry and paste the content from Obsidian. I\nassigned it to HyperKey+D and was able to trigger it while I was in my\nweb browser. I tinkered with it a little and was easily able to get it\nto close Day One after the entry was created.</p>\n\n<p>The process is simple. You start the recording of a macro from a button\non the menu bar. Your perform the action you need and Keysmith records\nyour clicks and keystrokes. When you&#39;re done, you save the macro, give\nit a name and assign a hotkey if you want to.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the example macros available for download on the Keysmith web\nsite are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Refresh extensions in Chrome</li>\n<li>Share screen in Discord</li>\n<li>Eject external hard drive in Finder</li>\n<li>Assign and submit a pull request on GitHub</li>\n<li>Enable Dark Mode in macOS</li>\n<li>New note with template in Apple Notes</li>\n<li>Switch to a specific Slack channel</li>\n<li>Switch to Zoom gallery view</li>\n<li>Quit all apps with AppleScript</li>\n<li>Close Notification Center in macOS</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You can use <a href=\"https://www.keysmith.app/purchase\">the total\nfunctionality of Keysmith for free</a> to make up to five macros. The\nfull version is $54. It is also available as part of <a\nhref=\"https://go.setapp.com/invite/kmjmclw4\">Setapp</a>.</p>\n<p>\n        <a href='mailto:lou@louplummer.lol?subject=Keysmith - Record Automation Macros With Ease' style='text-decoration: underline'>✉️ Reply by email</a>\n      </p>\n",

This week I\nfound out that an ancient app (well, 17 years), <a\nhref=\"https://amarsagoo.info/licensed/\">Licensed</a>, has been updated\nand is compatible with macOS 15. Licensed is a simple database to keep\ntrack of your software purchases.

We are all in this together and the enemy of our enemy is our friend. - Me in a 2020 organizing letter\n",

Just download and turn on both plugins\n2. Create a note within the folder with the exact name of the folder\n3. Add the following text to the that note %%Waypoint%%\n4. For any subfolders, add a note within the subfolder with the same name as the subfolder.\n5. Add the following text to that note %%Landmark%%\n\nThis will create real markdown links to the notes in the main and subfolders. Unlike MOCs generated with DataView, You can print and copy the text from Waypoint notes into other applications.\n\nBecause folders are binary, a file is either in a folder or it is not. If you want to add a note to a Waypoint based MOC, nothing is stopping you from manually creating the note. You can even combine a Waypoint note with the second type of note, the DataView MOC.\n\n## Tag Based\n\nIf you note organizational structure is tag based, you can create MOCs based on a simple DataView query. First, install and enable Dataview. It doesn't matter where in your vault that you place Dataview based MOCs. I have a folder call zz-Meta where all mine live. Use the following query to create a MOC based on a tag:\n\n> \n\n```dataview\n\nLIST\n\nFROM #tag_name\n\nSORT file.ctime DESC\n\n```\n\nOf course, nothing prevents you from manually adding notes to this MOC either.\n\n---\n### More Obsidian Info\n- [15 Example #Obsidian Vaults from Around the Internet | Lou Plummer (amerpie.lol)](https://amerpie.lol/2024/05/13/example-obsidian-vaults.html)\n- [77 Types of Notes to Keep in #Obsidian | Lou Plummer (amerpie.lol)](https://amerpie.lol/2024/04/28/types-of-notes.html)\n- [My Obsidian Journey and the Resources That Helped Me - Sample Vaults, Videos, Web Sites, Newsletters and Communities | Lou Plummer | (amerpie.lol)](https://amerpie.lol/2024/03/22/my-obsidian-journey.html)\n\n",

Update Your Plugins Wisely</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/swar8080/obsidian-plugin-update-tracker\">Plugins Update Tracker</a> notifies you when there are updates to your plugins. It creates a page with all of the release notes. You can set a delay of X days before you are notified if you prefer to wait awhile to make sure there are no bugs in the new releases. You can choose to be notified of beta versions if you want. You can update your plugins right from the Tracker&rsquo;s interface without opening Obsidian&rsquo;s prefs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4-create-a-homepage-with-search-recent-notes-and-bookmarks\">4. Create a Homepage with Search, Recent Notes and Bookmarks</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/andrewmcgivery/obsidian-beautitab\">The Beautitab plugin</a> lets you choose an image for the background, displays a clock, a quote, links to recently opened notes, links to recently bookmarked notes and your choice of a search interface (native or Omnisearch). You can turn off any element you don&rsquo;t want to use.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5-manually-order-notes\">5.

You can utilize custom wildcard or regex filters based on file/folder names, paths, and tags. Additionally,  a simple click in the file menu lets you hide or pin specific files or folders.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6-speed-up-obsidian-on-an-older-phone\">6. Speed Up Obsidian on an Older Phone</h2>\n<p>I contacted Obsidian support when I was having issues with<a href=\"https://amerpie.lol/2024/04/11/using-obsidian-on.html\">slow updates on my iPhone 11.</a> To  get better performance they suggested turning off backlinks and graph view on mobile and to not enable Dataview and Metabind. (Note: you have to have Obsidian sync to do this)</p>\n<h2 id=\"7-automatically-sync-a-copy-of-your-vault-daily\">7. Automatically Sync a Copy of Your Vault Daily</h2>\n<p>For Mac Users - <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sync-folders/id530573877\">SyncFoldersPro</a> lets you schedule folder sync operations. I run one daily to sync my Obsidian vault to Google Drive. As a bonus, it saves copies of moved, deleted and renamed files in a separate folder, allowing you to pull old versions of notes if anything ever goes wonky. <a href=\"https://amerpie.lol/2024/02/11/automating-your-obsidian.html\">It&rsquo;s saved my bacon more than once.</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"8-add-a-creation-date-and-modification-date-to-every-notes-properties\">8. Add a Creation Date and Modification Date to Every Note&rsquo;s Properties</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://amerpie.lol/2024/06/05/dont-be-afraid.html\">The Linter plugin</a> Has a setting to add a creation and modification date to every note which can prove very useful in building certain Dataview queries.</p>\n<h2 id=\"9-get-obsidian-sync\">9. Get Obsidian Sync</h2>\n<p>Quit trying to jank together some alternative solution and <a href=\"https://amerpie.lol/2024/06/19/the-case-for.html\">spend the $4 a month on Obsidian sync</a>. It allows you to selectively sync folders, eliminating the need for separate vaults, have custom preferences for your plugins on different devices, batch restore files and more. If you are a student, educator or non-profit employee, you get 40% off.</p>\n<h2 id=\"10-prevent-multiple-copies-of-the-same-note-from-opening\">10. Prevent Multiple Copies of the Same Note From Opening</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/czottmann/obsidian-mononote\">Mononote</a> is a simple plugin that prevents this aggravating behavior. Instead of having multiple tabs with the same note open, it just refocuses the existing tab, saving you time and memory.</p>\n",

Speed Up Obsidian on an Older Phone\nI contacted Obsidian support when I was having issues with[slow updates on my iPhone 11.](https://amerpie.lol/2024/04/11/using-obsidian-on.html) To  get better performance they suggested turning off backlinks and graph view on mobile and to not enable Dataview and Metabind. (Note: you have to have Obsidian sync to do this)\n\n## 7. Automatically Sync a Copy of Your Vault Daily\nFor Mac Users - [SyncFoldersPro](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sync-folders/id530573877) lets you schedule folder sync operations. I run one daily to sync my Obsidian vault to Google Drive. As a bonus, it saves copies of moved, deleted and renamed files in a separate folder, allowing you to pull old versions of notes if anything ever goes wonky. [It's saved my bacon more than once.](https://amerpie.lol/2024/02/11/automating-your-obsidian.html)\n\n## 8. Add a Creation Date and Modification Date to Every Note's Properties\n[The Linter plugin](https://amerpie.lol/2024/06/05/dont-be-afraid.html) Has a setting to add a creation and modification date to every note which can prove very useful in building certain Dataview queries.\n\n## 9. Get Obsidian Sync\nQuit trying to jank together some alternative solution and [spend the $4 a month on Obsidian sync](https://amerpie.lol/2024/06/19/the-case-for.html). It allows you to selectively sync folders, eliminating the need for separate vaults, have custom preferences for your plugins on different devices, batch restore files and more. If you are a student, educator or non-profit employee, you get 40% off.\n\n## 10. Prevent Multiple Copies of the Same Note From Opening\n[Mononote](https://github.com/czottmann/obsidian-mononote) is a simple plugin that prevents this aggravating behavior. Instead of having multiple tabs with the same note open, it just refocuses the existing tab, saving you time and memory.\n",

That&rsquo;s a wise attitude to take for plugins that affect data, but what about plugins that just make Obsidian easier to use? What&rsquo;s the reason for not trying those? These 10 plugins don&rsquo;t leave any code fragments in your notes. They just make Obsidian better.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1-commanderhttpsgithubcomphibr0obsidian-commander\">1. <a href=\"https://github.com/phibr0/obsidian-commander\">Commander</a></h2>\n<p>Commander lets you add and remove commands from the Obsidian interface. I use it to create ribbon bar buttons for shortcuts that add content to my daily note and to run the Linter plugin on demand. Commander can also edit commands, hide commands and for sync customers, choose what devices commands appear on.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2-editing-toolbarhttpsgithubcomcumanyobsidian-editing-toolbar\">2. <a href=\"https://github.com/cumany/obsidian-editing-toolbar\">Editing Toolbar</a></h2>\n<p>Even for seasoned Markdown writers, having access to an editing toolbar can come in handy for doing things like indenting or unindenting text. It also has very handy undo/redo buttons, superscript and subscript buttons and convenient color pickers for text and highlights. Inserting code blocks or inline code is also a breeze.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-file-explorerhttpsgithubcomkelszoobsidian-file-explorer-plus\">3. <a href=\"https://github.com/kelszo/obsidian-file-explorer-plus\">File Explorer++</a></h2>\n<p>One of the most frequently asked questions on Reddit is how to manually order folders and files. This simple plugin lets you both pin and hide folders and files with a click in the file menu.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4-mononotehttpsgithubcomczottmannobsidian-mononote\">4. <a href=\"https://github.com/czottmann/obsidian-mononote\">Mononote</a></h2>\n<p>Another simple but useful plugin is Mononote, by the same developer who created the super useful Actions for Obsidian, Mac and iOS shortcuts enhancer. Mononote does one thing, it keeps you from having multiple copies of the same note open at once. If you ever looked at your tab bar and seen multiple copies of your daily note staring at you, install this plugin to prevent that from ever happening again.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5-note-refactorhttpsgithubcomlynchjamesnote-refactor-obsidian\">5. <a href=\"https://github.com/lynchjames/note-refactor-obsidian\">Note Refactor</a></h2>\n<p>Note Refactor helps you split and extract content from your current notes. If you&rsquo;ve clipped a long web article and you want to break it down into smaller more easily digestible atomic notes, Note Refactor is the tool you want. You can preselect the location where you want your notes to go and even chose a naming convention for them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6-plugin-update-trackerhttpsgithubcomswar8080obsidian-plugin-update-tracker\">6. <a href=\"https://github.com/swar8080/obsidian-plugin-update-tracker\">Plugin Update Tracker</a></h2>\n<p>I&rsquo;m not the least bit ashamed to admit that I run between 50-60 plugins in my vault at any one time. Plugin Update Tracker lets me know at a glance if I have any updates and to what plugins. It will let me read the release notes and even wait a specified number days before notifying me when updates become available so that the early adopters can get the kinks worked out. If there are plugins you wish to ignore updates from, you can do that too.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7-read-it-laterhttpsgithubcomdominikpieperobsidian-readitlater\">7. <a href=\"https://github.com/DominikPieper/obsidian-ReadItLater\">Read It Later</a></h2>\n<p>ReadItLater collects information from your clipboard and creates notes based on the type of content you have saved there. Videos from YouTube, Billibilli, TikTok and Vimeo will be displayed in an inline iFrame based on the clipboard URL. Mastodon toots and URLs will be imported as complete notes generated from nothing more than a URL on your clipboard. It&rsquo;s one of the easiest ways to get web content in your blog. For plain text, the entire clipboard will be used to create a new note.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8-recent-fileshttpsgithubcomtgrosingerrecent-files-obsidian\">8. <a href=\"https://github.com/tgrosinger/recent-files-obsidian\">Recent Files</a></h2>\n<p>This plugin displays a list of most recently opened files in the sidebar. Optionally include paths of files which should be excluded from the list.

It will, of course show your tags as folders and even let you create time-based virtual tags for one hour, six hours, 3 days, 7 days and older than 7 days. You can configure ignored tags and folders if you want to.</p>\n<h2 id=\"10-tag-wranglerhttpsgithubcompjebytag-wrangler\">10. <a href=\"https://github.com/pjeby/tag-wrangler\">Tag Wrangler</a></h2>\n<p>I use this plugin to keep my tags clean.

Some of my wishes may have security complications of which I am not aware and others may be in the works. Some of these are partially achievable with plugins, I am aware but my desire is for more robust native functionality.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1-a-way-to-send-html-emails-to-obsidian\">1. A way to send HTML emails to Obsidian</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://amerpie.lol/2024/02/04/how-to-send.html\">I have a way of sending text emails to Obsidian</a> by forwarding them to Dropbox via IFTTT and then having the Mac utility change them to .md files and move them into my vault, but i would love to be able to figure out a way to het HTML emails into Obsidian with the formatting intact.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2-notifications-when-files-become-orphaned\">2.

Some of my wishes may have security complications of which I am not aware and others may be in the works. Some of these are partially achievable with plugins, I am aware but my desire is for more robust native functionality.\r\n\r\n## 1. A way to send HTML emails to Obsidian\r\n[I have a way of sending text emails to Obsidian](https://amerpie.lol/2024/02/04/how-to-send.html) by forwarding them to Dropbox via IFTTT and then having the Mac utility change them to .md files and move them into my vault, but i would love to be able to figure out a way to het HTML emails into Obsidian with the formatting intact.\r\n\r\n## 2. Notifications when files become orphaned \r\nThere are plugins that [promise to clean orphaned files](https://github.com/Vinzent03/find-unlinked-files), but I'd like a way to be notified as it happens so I can fix the issue that caused them to be orphaned or manually delete them on  the spot\r\n\r\n## 3. Print as RTF\r\nI don't print often, but having to export as PDF in order to preserve formatting is too many steps for my liking. I want to be able to have a print function that renders the note as a rich text file and prints it.\r\n\r\n## 4. Dataview queries that render when pasted (like Waypoint does)\r\nWhen you copy a Dataview query in a note, the system copies the underlying code, not the results of the query. You can't paste the results. [The Waypoint plugin](https://github.com/IdreesInc/Waypoint) is different. The links it generates can be copied and elsewhere. I'd like to see that extended.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 5. Native PDF searching\r\n[The Text Extractor plugin](https://github.com/scambier/obsidian-text-extractor) allows you to search PDFs, but it creates a bunch of extraneous files in your .Obsidian folder. If there is a way around that, I'd sure like to see it implemented. I do not keep any complicated PDFs in my vault because of the search limitation, something i was able to do in Evernote without a problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 6.

The Fiddling</h2>\n<p>A pox on people who complain that it&rsquo;s too tempting to fiddle with your Obsidian setup and therefore their ability to make more widgets for the man is negatively impacted. I love Obsidian because I can never stop optimizing it. If I wanted something that was set it and forget it, I&rsquo;d used TextEdit and miss out on so much joy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2-the-plugins\">2. The Plugins</h2>\n<p>I do not understand the weirdos who take perverse pride in ignoring the 1600+ ways to make Obsidian better. OK, I do get it if you don&rsquo;t want to affect the plain text functionality of your notes, but refusing to use plugins that do nothing but extend Obsidian&rsquo;s functionality is just masochism. <a href=\"https://amerpie.lol/2024/04/24/lesser-known-but.html\">I love the obscure ones the best</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"3-the-daily-note\">3. The Daily Note</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://amerpie.lol/2024/03/29/my-daily-note.html\">My Daily Note</a> gives me a comprehensive record of a snapshot in time, complete with weather, appointments, a running narrative, a gratitude list, tasks completed and more. It&rsquo;s fun to complie each day and it provides a great reference for what&rsquo;s been going on in my life.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4--writing-in-markdown\">4.  Writing in Markdown</h2>\n<p>I do almost all of my writing in Obsidian. All of my blog posts start there. Although I have the editing toolbar installed, I rarely need it any more as Markdown is pretty easy to learn and use. I love the added functionality that plugins like <a href=\"https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-url-into-selection\">Paste URL Into Selection</a> add to the writing experience.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5-obsidian-sync\">5. Obsidian Sync</h2>\n<p>I use Obsidian on two Macs, a PC, an iPhone and an iPad. Using Obsidian sync allows me to have customized plugins on every instance, to omit unneeded folders on mobile, to support Obsidian development by being a paying customer. Since I have a .edu email address, I get a 40% discount.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6-interoperability\">6. Interoperability</h2>\n<p>I love how the plain text/Markdown features in Obsidian along with it&rsquo;s local file storage allow me <a href=\"https://amerpie.lol/2024/02/22/obsidian-great-but.html\">to leverage other apps in my portfolio</a> to extend the functionality of Obsidian. Whether it&rsquo;s using Drafts or <a href=\"https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/bebop-quick-notes\">Bebop</a> for quick capture, or doing a search and replace across my entire vault with BBEdit, there are a big selection of companion apps to make Obsidian more powerful.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7-its-better-than-evernote\">7. It&rsquo;s Better than Evernote</h2>\n<p>I was an Evernote user from 2009-2023 and loved the automations it offered natively and via IFTTT. I&rsquo;ve figured out how to <a href=\"https://amerpie.lol/2024/02/04/how-to-send.html\">send emails to my vault,</a> and <a href=\"https://amerpie.lol/2024/03/17/my-bookmark-workflow.html\">import my Raindrio.io bookmarks</a> and every other thing I used to do with Evernote, plus I get all the other Obsidian deliciousness.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8-tags-folders-and-bookmarks\">8. Tags, Folders and Bookmarks</h2>\n<p>I started my vault with imports from Evernote and all of my tags carried over. Since then I&rsquo;ve maintained the tagging habit and it <a href=\"https://amerpie.lol/2024/03/06/my-dataview-use.html\">provides a lot of usefulness</a> when combined with Dataview. I also use folders for organization and bookmarks for work in progress notes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"9-the-obsidian-community\">9. The Obsidian Community</h2>\n<p>Whether it&rsquo;s Reddit, Discord, the official Obsidian forum or all the various YouTubers and bloggers, there are <a href=\"https://amerpie.lol/2024/03/17/my-bookmark-workflow.html\">a ton of resources</a> available to get new ideas and solve problems . I know of no other program with such a depth of material available.</p>\n<h2 id=\"10-backup-options\">10. Backup Options</h2>\n<p>I spend a lot of time working on my Obsidian notes and would be devastated to lose any data. That&rsquo;s why I have a TimeMachine backup, a Google Drive backup, a GitHub backup, plus Obsidian sync. <a href=\"https://amerpie.lol/2024/02/11/automating-your-obsidian.html\">It&rsquo;s all done with set it and forget it methods.</a></p>\n",

OK, I do get it if you don't want to affect the plain text functionality of your notes, but refusing to use plugins that do nothing but extend Obsidian's functionality is just masochism. [I love the obscure ones the best](https://amerpie.lol/2024/04/24/lesser-known-but.html)\n\n## 3. The Daily Note\n[My Daily Note](https://amerpie.lol/2024/03/29/my-daily-note.html) gives me a comprehensive record of a snapshot in time, complete with weather, appointments, a running narrative, a gratitude list, tasks completed and more. It's fun to complie each day and it provides a great reference for what's been going on in my life.\n\n## 4.  Writing in Markdown\nI do almost all of my writing in Obsidian. All of my blog posts start there. Although I have the editing toolbar installed, I rarely need it any more as Markdown is pretty easy to learn and use. I love the added functionality that plugins like [Paste URL Into Selection](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-url-into-selection) add to the writing experience.\n\n## 5. Obsidian Sync\nI use Obsidian on two Macs, a PC, an iPhone and an iPad. Using Obsidian sync allows me to have customized plugins on every instance, to omit unneeded folders on mobile, to support Obsidian development by being a paying customer. Since I have a .edu email address, I get a 40% discount.\n\n## 6. Interoperability \nI love how the plain text/Markdown features in Obsidian along with it's local file storage allow me [to leverage other apps in my portfolio](https://amerpie.lol/2024/02/22/obsidian-great-but.html) to extend the functionality of Obsidian. Whether it's using Drafts or [Bebop](https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/bebop-quick-notes) for quick capture, or doing a search and replace across my entire vault with BBEdit, there are a big selection of companion apps to make Obsidian more powerful.\n\n## 7. It's Better than Evernote\nI was an Evernote user from 2009-2023 and loved the automations it offered natively and via IFTTT. I've figured out how to [send emails to my vault,](https://amerpie.lol/2024/02/04/how-to-send.html) and [import my Raindrio.io bookmarks](https://amerpie.lol/2024/03/17/my-bookmark-workflow.html) and every other thing I used to do with Evernote, plus I get all the other Obsidian deliciousness. \n\n## 8. Tags, Folders and Bookmarks\nI started my vault with imports from Evernote and all of my tags carried over. Since then I've maintained the tagging habit and it [provides a lot of usefulness](https://amerpie.lol/2024/03/06/my-dataview-use.html) when combined with Dataview. I also use folders for organization and bookmarks for work in progress notes.\n\n## 9. The Obsidian Community\nWhether it's Reddit, Discord, the official Obsidian forum or all the various YouTubers and bloggers, there are [a ton of resources](https://amerpie.lol/2024/03/17/my-bookmark-workflow.html) available to get new ideas and solve problems . I know of no other program with such a depth of material available.\n\n## 10. Backup Options\nI spend a lot of time working on my Obsidian notes and would be devastated to lose any data. That's why I have a TimeMachine backup, a Google Drive backup, a GitHub backup, plus Obsidian sync. [It's all done with set it and forget it methods.](https://amerpie.lol/2024/02/11/automating-your-obsidian.html)\n",

				"title": "Don't Be Afraid to Use the Linter Plugin in #Obsidian",
				"content_html": "<p><img src=\"https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2024/cotton-linter-for-sodium-carboxymethyl-cellulose.jpeg\" alt=\"Cotton bolls fresh from the field\"></p>\n<p>One of the most powerful and seemingly complicated plugins in the Obsidian directory is <a href=\"https://github.com/platers/obsidian-linter?tab=readme-ov-file\">Linter</a>. With nine different tabs in its settings panel, it intimidated me until I spent some time looking it over and testing it on a small folder of test notes. Just installing it will do nothing to your notes. All the features are set to run on command initially and you can leave them that way perpetually if you just want to apply Linter settings manually to one folder of notes at the time. Linter describes itself thus: <strong>Format and style your notes. Linter can be used to format YAML tags, aliases, arrays, and metadata; footnotes; headings; spacing; math blocks; regular Markdown contents like list, italics, and bold styles; and more with the use of custom rule options.</strong></p>\n<p>To be clear, this is how you can select default file properties for all your notes or set custom file properties for notes one folder at the time. Using Linter will standardize the formatting of almost every element of your notes.</p>\n<p>If you have a lot of notes imported from different sources and especially if you have been using Obsidian since before the implementation of file properties, back when YAML front matter was created manually, you should be able to standardize the appearance and formatting of your vault. If you are a relatively new user, you can get a lot of benefit by setting some standards with Linter so that they apply to your notes going forward. I use the Commander Plugin to create a button in the Ribbon Bar to run Linter. I also created a keyboard shortcut to run Linter. The plugin creates an option in the right-click context menu to Lint a folder at the time.</p>\n<p><strong>General Tab</strong> - This is where you tell Linter when to apply its settings. If you choose &ldquo;Lint on save&rdquo;, the plugin will only apply its settings when you manually press Ctrl+S. If you select &ldquo;Lint on change, then the settings will apply as you edit notes&rdquo;. This tab is also where you can set Linter to ignore folders so that settings never apply to them. I set my Templates and Attachment folders to be ignored.</p>\n<p><strong>The YAML Tab</strong> - The settings I turn on are Add Blank Line After YAML, Dedupe YAML aliases, Dedupe, YAML tags, Dedupe YAML arrays.

				"content_text": "![Cotton bolls fresh from the field](https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2024/cotton-linter-for-sodium-carboxymethyl-cellulose.jpeg)\n\n\nOne of the most powerful and seemingly complicated plugins in the Obsidian directory is [Linter](https://github.com/platers/obsidian-linter?tab=readme-ov-file). With nine different tabs in its settings panel, it intimidated me until I spent some time looking it over and testing it on a small folder of test notes. Just installing it will do nothing to your notes. All the features are set to run on command initially and you can leave them that way perpetually if you just want to apply Linter settings manually to one folder of notes at the time. Linter describes itself thus: **Format and style your notes. Linter can be used to format YAML tags, aliases, arrays, and metadata; footnotes; headings; spacing; math blocks; regular Markdown contents like list, italics, and bold styles; and more with the use of custom rule options.**\n\nTo be clear, this is how you can select default file properties for all your notes or set custom file properties for notes one folder at the time. Using Linter will standardize the formatting of almost every element of your notes.\n\nIf you have a lot of notes imported from different sources and especially if you have been using Obsidian since before the implementation of file properties, back when YAML front matter was created manually, you should be able to standardize the appearance and formatting of your vault. If you are a relatively new user, you can get a lot of benefit by setting some standards with Linter so that they apply to your notes going forward. I use the Commander Plugin to create a button in the Ribbon Bar to run Linter. I also created a keyboard shortcut to run Linter. The plugin creates an option in the right-click context menu to Lint a folder at the time.\n\n**General Tab** - This is where you tell Linter when to apply its settings. If you choose \"Lint on save\", the plugin will only apply its settings when you manually press Ctrl+S. If you select \"Lint on change, then the settings will apply as you edit notes\". This tab is also where you can set Linter to ignore folders so that settings never apply to them. I set my Templates and Attachment folders to be ignored.\n\n**The YAML Tab** - The settings I turn on are Add Blank Line After YAML, Dedupe YAML aliases, Dedupe, YAML tags, Dedupe YAML arrays. I set Linter to move all YAML tags to the front matter. In the sorting section, I turn on sorting for aliases, tags and arrays in ascending alphabetical order. In the YAML key sort section I turn on sorting and enable priority sorting for the following properties:\n\ttitle:\n\tauthor: \n\turl:\n\ttags:\n\tcreation date:\n\tmodification date:\nThis will create those properties in every note I create in that exact order, with additional properties included beneath them in ascending alphabetical order.\n\nI turn on the automatic inclusion of creation date and modification date using the YYYY-MM-DD format. This is useful when building certain Dataview queries later.\n\nThe only other setting I turn on in this tab is the YAML title which I set to match the file name.\n\n**H1 Headings Tab** - On this tab I turn on Capitalize Headings, Ignore Cased Words, and Remove Trailing Punctuation Headings\n\n**Footnote Tab** - I don't make any changes here as I don't use footnotes\n\n**Content Tab** - I turn on every setting on this tab for consistency's sake except for default language for code settings since I don't use code fences for anything other than markdown.\n\n**Spacing Tab** - On this tab I turn on Consecutive Blank Lines, Convert Tabs to Spaces, Empty Line Around Blockquotes, All Heading Blank Lines, Line Break at Document End, Paragraph Blank Lines, Remove Empty Lines Between List Markers, Remove Link Spacing, All the settings for trailing spaces\n\n**Paste Tab** - I turn on everything except Remove Leftover Footnotes\n\n**Custom Tab** - No changes\n\n**Debug Tab** - No changes\n\nThe Linter user manual can be accessed [here](https://platers.github.io/obsidian-linter/).\n\nThis is a powerful tool. Before applying it to your entire vault, ensure you have a backup.\n",

I have two personal workspaces: one for social media and blogging and another general workspace.\r\n\r\nMy social and blogging workspace has tabs open for:\r\n- [Lou Plummer  (@amerpie@social.lol) - social.lol](https://social.lol/@amerpie) - my primary Mastodon account\r\n- [Lou Plummer (@amerpie@onephoto.club) - One Photo Club](https://onephoto.club/@amerpie) - a second Mastodon account for travel photos\r\n- [Lou Plummer  (@amerpie.lol) — Bluesky (bsky.app)](https://bsky.app/profile/amerpie.lol)\r\n- [Lou Plummer  (@CycleLou) / X](https://x.com/CycleLou)\r\n- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/lou.plummer/)\r\n- [Pxlmo](https://pxlmo.com/i/web/profile/661172620159349050)\r\n- [Lou Plummer | LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lou-plummer-01086a88/)\r\n- [Lou Plummer  (@amerpie) on Farcaster (warpcast.com)](https://warpcast.com/amerpie)\r\n- [Lou Plummer — Refrakt](https://refrakt.app/amerpie)\r\n- [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/)\r\n- [Sites | tinylytics](https://tinylytics.app/)\r\n- [Explore Posts | Scribbles](https://scribbles.page/explore).\r\n- [OMG.LOL](https://omg.lol)\r\n\r\n**Total social and blogging tags = 13**\r\n\r\nMy general browsing workspace has tabs for:\r\n- Gmail (personal email)\r\n- Yahoo mail (used only for newsletters)\r\n- Google Drive\r\n- Raindrop.io bookmarks\r\n- [Gemini (google.com)](https://gemini.google.com/app)\r\n- [Reddit - Dive into anything](https://www.reddit.com/)\r\n- Plus whatever I happen to be interested in at any given moment, usually about a half-dozen tabs\r\n\r\n**Total general browsing tabs = 12**\r\n\r\n### Total Tabs = 40\r\n\r\n## Other Considerations\r\n\r\nI use the great Mac app, [Velja](https://sindresorhus.com/velja), to let me pick what browser or app opens links. I have five browsers installed, Edge, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Orion and Arc. I prefer to open YouTube links in [Freetube](https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/freetube-maybe-the-most-underrated-app). And though I usually use the default web interface for Mastodon, I also use [Ivory](https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/ivory-for-mastodon-by-tapbots) for its notification center actions. [Inoreader](https://amerpie.lol/2024/03/20/inoreader-absolutely-worth.html) is my RSS provider and I use an Edge PWA to access my feed.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

You can use Picyard to create images, testimonials, code snippets, QR codes and then download them as png or jpeg files.\n\n## Simple Page Builder\n\n![Full screenshot of the web page builder](https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2024/cleanshot-2024-05-03-at-12.43.592x.jpeg)\n\n[Simple Page Builder](https://simplepagebuilder.app/)will do everything you need to design a web page, up to and including helping you register for one the free hosting sites [Glitch](https://simplepagebuilder.app/tutorial#hosting-glitch) or [Neocities](https://simplepagebuilder.app/tutorial#hosting-neocities). It explains design principals, basic coding and file management.\n\n## Hemingway Editor\n\n![A fullscreen shot of the Hemingway online editor](https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2024/cleanshot-2024-05-03-at-12.51.312x.jpeg)\n\n[The Hemingway Editor](https://4.hemingwayapp.com/) cuts the dead weight from your writing. It highlights wordy sentences in yellow and more egregious ones in red. Hemingway helps you write with power and clarity by highlighting adverbs, passive voice, and dull, complicated words. It even shows you the reading level required to understand your writing style. \n\n## Tinylytics\n\n![Stats generated by Tinylytics](https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2024/cleanshot-2024-05-03-at-12.58.032x.jpeg)\n\n[Tinylytics](https://tinylytics.app/) is an analytics tool for small websites. It's designed to be simple to use and self explanatory. There is documentation on the site covering:\n- [Embedding the script](https://tinylytics.app/docs/embedding_your_script)\n- [Showing a hit counter](https://tinylytics.app/docs/show_hit_counter)\n- [Showing kudos](https://tinylytics.app/docs/showing_kudos)\n- [Showing uptime](https://tinylytics.app/docs/showing_uptime)\n- [Showing the webring](https://tinylytics.app/docs/showing_webring)\n- [Showing countries](https://tinylytics.app/docs/showing_countries)\n- [Ignoring your own hits](https://tinylytics.app/docs/ignore_your_hits)\n\n## Canva Color Wheel\n\n\n![A graphic of the Canva color wheel](https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2024/cleanshot-2024-05-03-at-13.05.452x.jpeg)\n\nIf you are advanced enough to write your own CSS, you will probably need a color reference from time to time. [The Canva Color Wheel](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-wheel/) provides not only colors for your code, it also advises you on what colors work well together. I've even used it to help with the settings in Obsidian.\n\n## Unsplash\n\n![A couple walking down the beach holding hands shown from the shoulders down in the back](https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2024/asdrubal-luna-kc2esbl2l-w-unsplash.jpeg)\n\n[Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) is my go to web site for royalty-free stock photography. There is no need to steal graphics from Google when so much is available for free from Unsplash. The images are easy to download and they have a huge assortment for you to search by keyword.\n\n## Lex\n\n![A list of the features of the Lex writing assistant](https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2024/cleanshot-2024-05-03-at-13.21.492x.jpeg)\n\n[Lex](https://lex.page/~) is your AI editor for Google Docs. Not only does it check your spelling and grammar, [Lex](https://lex.page/~) also brainstorms ideas, helps to come up with titles and will do rewrites of your work in a different style. It features versioning if you need to save what you've already written while contemplating the edited version. Like anywhere on Google Docs, you can work with collaborators without them needing to download an app.\n\n",

This is what I pay to stay entertained, informed and to keep my digital memories backed up.\n\n\n\n\n\n# Subscriptions\n\nSubscriptions\n\n| Televison                | per month | per year |\n| Netflix                  | $15.49    |          |\n| Amazon Prime             | $14.57    |          |\n| Acorn                    | $6.99     |          |\n| BritBox                  | $8.99     |          |\n| Max                      | $9.21     | $110.49  |\n| Hulu                     | $17.99    |          |\n| AppleTV+                 | $9.99     |          |\n| Peacock                  | $13.99    |          |\n| Paramount+               | $5.00     | $60.00   |\n|                          | $102.22   |          |\n|                          |           |          |\n| News                     |           |          |\n| Washington Post          | $10.00    |          |\n|                          | $10.00    |          |\n|                          |           |          |\n| Software and Services    |           |          |\n| Inoreader                |           |          |\n| TextExpander             |           |          |\n| GoogleOne AI             | $19.99    |          |\n| iCloud                   | $9.99     |          |\n| Carrot Weather           | $0.83     | $9.99    |\n| Day One                  | $2.08     | $24.99   |\n| Drafts                   | $1.67     | $19.99   |\n| Due                      | $0.42     | $4.99    |\n| iTunes Match             | $2.08     | $24.99   |\n| Ivory                    | $2.08     | $24.99   |\n| Listy                    | $0.92     | $10.99   |\n| Overcast                 | $0.83     | $9.99    |\n| Parcel                   | $0.42     | $4.99    |\n| Play                     | $1.67     | $19.99   |\n| Reddit                   | $6.99     |          |\n| Subscriptions            | $0.17     | $1.99    |\n| Micro.blog               | $10.00    |          |\n| Scribbles                | $2.50     |          |\n| Tinylytics               | $5.00     |          |\n| Setapp                   | $11.24    |          |\n| Monarch Money            | $8.33     |          |\n| Murmel                   | $1.99     |          |\n| BearBlog                 | $5.00     |          |\n| Contacts Sync            | $0.83     | $9.99    |\n| MyTracks                 | $0.42     | $4.99    |\n| Sequel                   | $1.67     | $19.99   |\n| IFTTT                    | $3.99     |          |\n|                          | $101.09   |          |\n|                          |           |          |\n| Included with Cell Phone |           |          |\n| Disney TV                |           |          |\n| Apple Music              |           |          |\n|                          |           |          |\n| Blogs                    |           |          |\n| Hey Dingus               | $1.00     |          |\n| Matt Langford            | $1.00     |          |\n| Flohgro                  | $1.00     |          |\n| Vlad Campos              | $1.00     |          |\n| Manuel Moreale           | $1.00     |          |\n| Numeric Citizen          | $1.00     |          |\n|                          | $6.00     |          |\n|                          |           |          |\n| Total                    | $219.31   |          |\n",

When I initially heard about <a href=\"https://raycast.com\">Raycast</a>, I wasn&rsquo;t interested, but the uproar just kept getting louder. Tech bloggers and Reddit sang its praises and kept pointing out new features one after another. I finally relented and downloaded it. After spending my Thanksgiving break of 2023 getting it configured to match my needs, I&rsquo;ve been an enthusiastic proponent ever since.

Clipboard History</h2>\n<p>I used to use <a href=\"https://indiegoodies.com/pastepal\">Pastepal</a> and at times I miss its ability to sync my clipboard with my phone, but there are work arounds for that. By using Raycast&rsquo;s built in clipboard manager, I eliminate the need to run a separate program at all times. It&rsquo;s very convenient to assign a hotkey combo to show my clipboard history and then to navigate it without the need for a mouse.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2-kill-process\">2. Kill Process</h2>\n<p>When I have the infrequent application crash, I don&rsquo;t have to remember the Apple keyboard combo for force quitting an application nor do I have to use a mouse to click on the dock or Apple Menu. I just launch Raycast and type &ldquo;Kill Process&rdquo; and then the name of the rouge program and hit enter. Boom, just like that the crash is over and I can relaunch the application if I want to.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-image-modification\">3. Image Modification</h2>\n<p>As a blogger, I have a frequent need to reduce the size of images before I post them on my website. The image modification plugin acts on whatever file is selected in the finder. I specify the width I want and it figures out the height for me. If I want to convert an image from a PNG to a JPG, it can handle that too. It can also pad and scale images as well as removing EXIF data.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4-emoji-picker\">4. Emoji Picker</h2>\n<p>I used to use <a href=\"https://matthewpalmer.net/rocket/\">Rocket</a>, a separate program as an emoji picker but the one built into Raycast works just as well.

I use the hotkey fn+E to summon the emoji picker and I do it often 😃.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5-unsplash\">5. Unsplash</h2>\n<p>When I&rsquo;m looking for a stock photo to use on my blog, I can use the <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/\">Unsplash</a> extension to do it right from Raycast without having to use a web browser.

The Obsidian forums and Reddit are full of questions about the best ways to use them. There&rsquo;s no doubting the power of these plugins and the value they add to Obsidian. But what about the lesser-known work of volunteer developers who make up the backbone of the devout Obsidian community? What about more niche cases and hidden gems? Let&rsquo;s look at some of those. All of these have less than 50K downloads, some of them much lower than that.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2024/b8bb6c0a83.jpeg\" alt=\"A homepage from the Obsidian app with a picture of a mountain\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"1-beautitab\">1.

Automatic Table of Contents</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/johansatge/obsidian-automatic-table-of-contents\">Automatic Table of Contents</a> is useful for long and detailed notes. It will create a table of contents for you at the top of a note based on the headers you have used. If you make changes to the note, the table of contents will automatically change to reflect your input.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7--media-db\">7.  Media DB</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/mProjectsCode/obsidian-media-db-plugin\">Media DB</a> is useful if you use Obsidian to track content consumption.

Attachment Management</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/trganda/obsidian-attachment-management\">Attachment Management</a> plugin is central to my workflow for the importation of web content. It centralizes the location on attachments in a single folder with subfolders matching the structure of my vault. It renames images to match the note names they are a part of. It works well with the Local Images Plus plugin. If you have folders where you don&rsquo;t want the attachments moved or renamed, setting up exclusion rules is easy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"10-waypoint\">10. Waypoint</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/IdreesInc/Waypoint\">Waypoint</a> is an Obsidian plugin that automatically generates tables of contents/MOCs within your folder notes.

It only takes a couple of minutes, and it saves me from having marathon sessions of updates if I keep putting it off.

If it's something I want to read later, I bookmark it - because I have a weekly task to read my bookmarked notes. I also have an Obsidian folder where emails arrive when[I send them via an IFTTT action](https://amerpie.lol/2024/02/04/how-to-send.html). I clear that daily too. I make sure that any [Omnivore](https://omnivore.app/home) highlights, notes or articles are properly tagged and that the metadata matches my preferred format. The last step is making sure I've completed [my daily note](https://amerpie.lol/2024/03/29/my-daily-note.html). I add to it throughout the day as a journal, but at night I like to reflect a bit and add [what I'm grateful for that day](https://louplummer.lol/post/the-gratitude-habit-fhipsvhb).\r\n\r\n## Updates\r\n\r\nI have nearly 400 apps installed on my MacBook and an equivalent number on my iPhone. I run two Mac apps nightly to check for updates, [Mac Updater](https://www.corecode.io/macupdater/) and [Latest](https://max.codes/latest/). It only takes a couple of minutes, and it saves me from having marathon sessions of updates if I keep putting it off. The other thing I update is [Trakt](https://trakt.tv/dashboard), a media tracking service that allows me to keep a record of my viewing habits. \r\n\r\nFollowing this plan, making it an integral part of my evening routine helps me stay on top of the things that are important to me. The systems I have in place function smoothly because of this checklist. It's an evolving habit and I add and remove items as I need to. \n",

I write in Obsidian more often than not.

I save my drafts in my vault, using file properties to track the topic and published URL.\n- **Daily notes 7** - I start and end every day with [my daily note.](https://amerpie.lol/2024/03/29/my-daily-note.html).

I use u\\kepano's templates from [the vault he shared on GitHub](https://github.com/kepano/kepano-obsidian)\r\n- on my iPhone, I record where I eat lunch and link it to a restaurant template and file class I configured with the [Metadata Menu](https://github.com/mdelobelle/metadatamenu) plugin.\r\n- During the evening, I record what I watch on TV using [the Media DB plugin](https://github.com/mProjectsCode/obsidian-media-db-plugin)\r\n- Before I go to bed, I have a nightly checklist in [Things 3](https://culturedcode.com/things/) that involves me clearing my Obsidian inbox and internally bookmarking anything I need to read later. I also use this time to make a quick three-bullet gratitude list as part of my daily note.\r\n- I have [a workflow for sending emails to Obsidian](https://amerpie.lol/2024/02/04/how-to-send.html) and I clear that folder out each night too.\r\n- I check to see if [Omnivore, my Read Later Service](https://amerpie.lol/2024/01/27/the-omnivore-to.html) has any imported pages or highlights I need to file.\r\n- The last thing I check is whether I need to [import any bookmarks](https://amerpie.lol/2024/03/17/my-bookmark-workflow.html) I've made that day in Raindrop.io. This can be automated but I prefer to do it manually to make sure I correctly file and/or link web pages to any current MOCs\n",

It offers far more than basic screenshots with tools for annotations, blurring, screen recording, and a scrolling capture mode. CleanShot X delivers professional-looking visuals and clear communication effortlessly. I&rsquo;ve used other apps like <a href=\"https://shottr.cc/\">Shottr</a> and <a href=\"https://www.techsmith.com/screen-capture.html\">SnagIt</a>) and I find that CleanShot X offers more.

(One-time purchase price is $9.99 without Setapp)\n\n## CloudMounter\n\n[CloudMounter](https://cloudmounter.net/) connects your Mac to cloud storage services like Dropbox, Google Drive, and OneDrive. It mounts these services as local drives, allowing you to manage your online files directly from Finder. I like it because it let's me avoid having to run the native app for each application. (annual license is $39.99 when purchased without SetApp)\n\n## AlDente Pro\n\n[AlDente Pro](https://apphousekitchen.com/) protects your MacBook battery by intelligently managing its charging behavior. It lets you set a maximum charge percentage to prolong battery lifespan and offers various customizable settings for optimal battery health. I keep my maximum charge set to 70% on my MacBook Air, although I can easily top it off to 100% if I need to be on battery for a prolonged time. (One time purchase of $25 without SetApp)\n\n## HoudahSpot\n\n[HoudahSpot](https://www.houdah.com/houdahSpot/?lang=en) transforms your Mac's search capabilities. It builds upon Spotlight, offering complex search criteria including file attributes, content, and metadata. I use the saved search functions to find all the Markdown files created in the last seven days (run as a weekly task) to import my [Obsidian](hrrps://obsidian.md) files into [EagleFiler](https://c-command.com/eaglefiler/). (One-time purchase price of $39.00 without SetApp)\n\n## PathFinder\n\n[PathFinder](https://www.cocoatech.io/) is a powerful file management alternative to macOS Finder. It offers advanced features like dual-pane browsing, batch renaming, deep folder comparisons, and customizable interface modules. This is another app I've used for more than a decade. (Annual subscription $29.99 without SetApp)\n\n## Default Folder X\n\n[Default Folder X](https://www.stclairsoft.com/DefaultFolderX/) enhances your Mac's Open and Save dialog boxes. It offers quick access to recent folders, favorites, powerful keyboard shortcuts, and default folder management. I'm a long-time user and no longer have to pay any upgrade fees. (One-time license costs $34,95 without Setapp)\n\n## Dropzone\n\n[Dropzone](https://aptonic.com/) supercharges your Mac's productivity with its drag-and-drop interface. It lets you send files to apps, shorten URLs, execute custom scripts, and much more – all by simply dragging files or text snippets onto its icon. I use a script to automatically install apps from DMG files and a shortcut that uploads media files to [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog) (License is $35 without Setapp)\n\n## CleanShot X\n\n[CleanShot X](https://cleanshot.com/) elevates screen capturing on your Mac. It offers far more than basic screenshots with tools for annotations, blurring, screen recording, and a scrolling capture mode. CleanShot X delivers professional-looking visuals and clear communication effortlessly. I've used other apps like [Shottr](https://shottr.cc/) and [SnagIt](https://www.techsmith.com/screen-capture.html)) and I find that CleanShot X offers more. (Subscription is $10 a month for the cloud service plan without SetApp)\n",

				"content_html": "<p><img src=\"https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2024/school.jpeg\" alt=\"https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2024/school.jpeg\"></p>\n<p>After retiring from my IT career in public education in 2020, I found myself less engaged with technology news and updates. My previous habit of upgrading my phone yearly faded, and I continued using the software already on my MacBook. An Evernote user since 2009, I relied on it for everything from technical specs to recipes. My subscription auto-renewed annually without much thought.</p>\n<p>Within a few years, it became clear that staying at home full-time wasn&rsquo;t for me. Through connections, I landed a relaxed role in the IT department at a small, private university in my hometown. It&rsquo;s the perfect post-retirement job: I enjoy helping faculty, staff, and students with their tech problems without the headaches of being on-call, budgeting, or strategic planning.</p>\n<p>Around that time, I noticed an unfamiliar program, Obsidian, gaining popularity among the tech circles I used to follow. David Sparks (MacSparky) wrote an entire <a href=\"https://learn.macsparky.com/p/obsidianfg\">field guide about it</a>and The Sweet Setup offered a <a href=\"https://thesweetsetup.com/rm/obsidian-starter-vault/\">sample starter vault</a>. Since the guide was expensive and the sample vault was free, I naturally started there. I <a href=\"https://obsidian.md/download\">downloaded Obsidian</a> and figured out how to access my new files.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-starter-vault\">A Starter Vault</h2>\n<p>The Sweet Setup&rsquo;s Starter Vault includes articles about common Obsidian use cases like journaling.

				"content_text": "![https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2024/school.jpeg](https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2024/school.jpeg)\n\nAfter retiring from my IT career in public education in 2020, I found myself less engaged with technology news and updates. My previous habit of upgrading my phone yearly faded, and I continued using the software already on my MacBook. An Evernote user since 2009, I relied on it for everything from technical specs to recipes. My subscription auto-renewed annually without much thought.\n\nWithin a few years, it became clear that staying at home full-time wasn't for me. Through connections, I landed a relaxed role in the IT department at a small, private university in my hometown. It's the perfect post-retirement job: I enjoy helping faculty, staff, and students with their tech problems without the headaches of being on-call, budgeting, or strategic planning.\n\nAround that time, I noticed an unfamiliar program, Obsidian, gaining popularity among the tech circles I used to follow. David Sparks (MacSparky) wrote an entire [field guide about it](https://learn.macsparky.com/p/obsidianfg)and The Sweet Setup offered a [sample starter vault](https://thesweetsetup.com/rm/obsidian-starter-vault/). Since the guide was expensive and the sample vault was free, I naturally started there. I [downloaded Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/download) and figured out how to access my new files.\n\n## A Starter Vault\n\nThe Sweet Setup's Starter Vault includes articles about common Obsidian use cases like journaling. It provides instructions on how to download, install, and configure community plugins, and how to integrate them with the core plugins that come built-in, like the daily note plugin. My journaling habit and my use of the [Quick Add plugin](https://github.com/chhoumann/quickadd) began on day one thanks to this resource.\n\nWhile other demo vaults are available, I recommend waiting a bit before exploring them. This gives you time to familiarize yourself with your own setup before adopting someone else's system. Some notable ones include:\n\n- The Ellane W. [Obsidian Demo Vault](https://miscellaneplans.gumroad.com/l/planner-vault) Ellane is a strong advocate for plain text within the Obsidian community. I've interacted with her on Mastodon: [@ellane@pkm.social](https://micro.blog/ellane@pkm.social)\n- [The Lean Productivity Starter Vault](https://store.sascha-kasper.com/l/obvault?layout=profile) This vault by Sascha Kasper is comprehensive, covering organization, metadata, templates, core and community plugins, and even CSS snippets.\n\n## YouTube\n\nI realized early on that Obsidian has a steeper learning curve than most software, but there seemed to be ample resources to help. True to the 21st century, I turned to YouTube and stumbled upon the perfect beginner's video: Nick Milo's [Linking Your Thinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbLb6QCK88&t=311s).

Raindrop.io is a multi-featured bookmark manager with a web interface and native apps for Mac and PC. It allows you to add sites to your collection via a browser extension.

If you rely on PDFs for reference, you can upload your library to Raindrop.io&rsquo;s servers and take advantage of full text search and universal availability. For regular web sites, Raindrop.io saves an archive of the page when you add it to your collection so you never have to worry about losing access to an article if it gets pulled from the Internet or disappears behind a paywall. You get daily backups. I have mine saved to Dropbox so I get a local copy of them downloaded to my computer.</p>\n<p>Integrations I use include YouTube where every time I give a video a thumbs up it gets added to Raindrop.io. My RSS service, <a href=\"https://www.inoreader.com/\">Inoreader</a>, allows me to add pages directly to my bookmarks and it automates it even further by also adding starred (read later) articles as well. I also imported all my articles from <a href=\"https://getpocket.com/home\">Pocket</a> and for awhile synced my bookmarks with an <a href=\"https://evernote.com/\">Evernote</a> notebook.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://amerpie.lol/uploads/2024/raindrop1.png\" alt=\"A screenshot listing the paid features of Raindrop.io\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"obsidian-integration\">Obsidian Integration</h2>\n<p>I try to make <a href=\"https://obsidian.md\">Obsidian</a> the center of my digital life.

He told me he was playing with Legos during that time. I don't know if he intended to make me feel old (I'm almost 60) but he did. I wasn't trying to make him feel callow, just telling a story. Anyway, I gotta get my head wrapped around aggressive go-getters with something to prove. I just want to stay out of his way and do my thing. Why do men have to make every goddamn thing a competition? I still love computers after spending all these years with them. I enjoy technology and the last thing I want to do is compete with someone younger than my children over who can write the best powershell script or configure a Cisco switch in the least amount of time. I'd rather talk about how much I enjoy using Obsidian or how insanely long my MacBook battery lasts. Something fun. Don't suck the joy out anyone's work life, y'all. Just don't do it. \n",

On top of Obsidian's built-in versioning (a must-have), I backup the whole vault to my Mac's Time Machine, keep a versioned copy on GitHub using [the Obsidian Git plugin](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git), and sync a local copy to both my PC and Mac with automatic Google Drive uploads. For local sync, I rely on [Sync Folders Pro](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sync-folders/id530573877) (Mac) for its nightly auto-sync, plus [Free File Sync](https://freefilesync.org/) (Mac/PC) for occasional manual backups.\n\n[More information on automating Obsidian backups](https://amerpie.lol/2024/02/11/automating-your-obsidian.html)\n\nSpeaking of organization, I've dabbled with [EagleFiler](https://c-command.com/eaglefiler/) and [Devonthink](https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink) on my Mac. These knowledge management apps index my Obsidian vault alongside years of Gmail, Facebook, Evernote, tons of PDFs… you get the idea. They keep my main vault lean while giving me powerful search across all my data.\n\n## Obsidian Power-Ups for Mobile\n\n![](https://cdn.some.pics/amerpie/65d793f60db7a.jpg)\n\nObsidian's mobile app has one major weakness: slow load times. While the developers are working on it, immediate data entry just isn't its strength yet. Upgraded phone or not, I still experience lag. My workaround is the brilliant iOS app [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/). It's a lightning-fast text capture tool, has great Markdown support, and with a tap you can send everything to Obsidian (even from desktop!).\n\nOther amazing text editors pair perfectly with Obsidian. [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) is a minimalist's dream. It strips away distractions for pure writing focus, especially when it comes to Markdown. You can work directly on your vault without even opening the Obsidian app. [1Writer](https://1writerapp.com/) is another fantastic, more budget-friendly option that handles plain text and Markdown beautifully.\n\nLet me know what you think!\n\n### [See all my Obsidian Tips](https://amerpie.lol/obsidian)\n",

Whether you rely on the Dataview plugin or embedded queries, properties play a vital role.

Luckily, there are three powerful plugins that can streamline your metadata management in Obsidian: <a href=\"https://github.com/platers/obsidian-linter\">Linter</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/mdelobelle/metadatamenu\">Metadata Menu</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/fez-github/obsidian-multi-properties\">Multi Properties</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"linter-pluginstreamline-your-defaults\">Linter Plugin—Streamline Your Defaults</h2>\n<p>Among the trio, Linter stands out as the most robust plugin. With enough customization, it can accomplish what the other two plugins offer. However, I prefer using Linter for general defaults while using the other plugins for specific cases. Linter excels at applying a default set of properties to all your notes, and I use the following essential properties:</p>\n<pre><code>&gt;```\ntitle:\nurl:\ntags:\ncreation date:\nmodification date:\n```\n</code></pre>\n<p>Furthermore, Linter offers the flexibility of adding additional properties, which it conveniently lists in alphabetical order. You can also choose the date format, with the recommended format being YYYY-MM-DD. Another impressive feature of Linter is its ability to move tags from the note body to the metadata section.

Whether you want to group notes within a folder or classify them by a common tag, this plugin offers remarkable flexibility. While the Templater plugin can achieve similar functionality, Metadata Menu eliminates the need to learn special syntax. It&rsquo;s worth noting that Templater can be less reliable on Mac systems. To learn more about how to leverage Metadata Menu effectively, check out <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOw_LtMgMlQ\">Marco Serafini&rsquo;s YouTube video</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"multi-propertiesquick-and-easy\">Multi Properties—Quick and Easy</h2>\n<p>If you need a quick and effortless method to add properties on the go, the Multi Properties plugin is your go-to solution.

Twelve years later, we don&rsquo;t add to that notebook any more but you better believe I still have it for a super-sweet way to look back on those days.

It only makes sense to use the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/family-sharing/\">Apple Family Sharing</a> plan to get more use out of the apps we (I) buy, a joint Apple Music subscription and 2TB of shared iCloud storage. We also rely on iMessage as our main text communication. We keep separate iCloud photo libraries because we use <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Photos/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=13234696011\">Amazon Photos</a> for unlimited joint storage of not only our phone pics and videos but also shots she takes with her DSLR.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.some.pics/amerpie/65abde92e90a2.jpg\" alt=\"A screenshot of a packing list for a camping trip in Anylist app\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"anylist\">Anylist</h2>\n<p>For more than a decade, we&rsquo;ve used <a href=\"https://www.anylist.com/\">Anylist</a>to manage our grocery shopping. It&rsquo;s got an <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/id522167641\">iOS app</a>, a <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/any-do-to-do-list-calendar/id944960179?mt=12\">Mac app</a> and a web interface for when we are at work forced to use a PC. As the chief cook at our house I also use it&rsquo;s recipe import and storage capability, which rivals that of the better known Paprika. We even use Anylist to keep our reusable packing lists for trips to her races, camping trips and other travel. Anylist integrates with <a href=\"https://help.anylist.com/articles/anylist-skill-for-amazon-alexa/\">Amazon&rsquo;s Alexa app</a> on the Echo so we can just tell her to add things to the shopping list while we are in the kitchen.

This free app is the medium we use to share information that use to get lost in a sea of texts. When I find an app,  restaurant, movie or TV show to suggest, I use the iOS share sheet to add it to Aboard. My wife gets a notification and the app provides a way to comment on the link. We can also share photos and documents to Aboard. It even has a <a href=\"https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/aboard/epfokbjhopgfjfdaeaonacbahioofmol?hl=en-US\">browser extension</a> so we can both add things while we work on our PCs.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.some.pics/amerpie/65abe08cee28b.png\" alt=\"A screenshot of our Kindle library\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"amazon-and-alexa\">Amazon and Alexa</h2>\n<p>As I mentioned, we use an Amazon Echo, specifically an <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BHZX3TYV/?ie=UTF8\">Echo Show 15</a>, in our kitchen. It&rsquo;s the digital message board for our house with a visual representation of our family shopping list, our joint todo list, a collection of family photos and a constantly updated weather report. We use a joint Amazon account, which allows us to also share <a href=\"https://read.amazon.com/kindle-library\">Kindle</a> e-books and <a href=\"https://www.audible.com/\">Audible</a> audio books. We&rsquo;ve been using those services so heavily and for so long that we have hundreds of each.</p>\n<h2 id=\"surviving-passwords\">Surviving Passwords</h2>\n<p>Before Apple <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/iphone/iphe6b2b7043/ios\">implemented shared passwords</a> in Mac OS 14 (Sonoma) and iOS 17, we already had a method of securely keping and sharing passwords and other sensitive date with a <a href=\"https://www.lastpass.com/products/family-password-manager\">LastPass Family Sharing Plan.</a>It&rsquo;s more full-featured than Keychain since it has the capability of storing secure notes and documents as well as passwords. One thing we&rsquo;ve done is made sure that we both have access to each other&rsquo;s LastPass vault if we become the lone survivor of our marriage. We&rsquo;ve done the same with <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/102631#:~:text=Share%20the%20access%20key%20with,ID%20and%20access%20your%20data.\">Apple</a> and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-give-google-account-to-trusted-person-when-you-die-2018-8\">Google</a>. Please make sure you do the same!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.some.pics/amerpie/65abe2395999e.png\" alt=\"A Screenshot of the TV apps on my iPhone\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"thats-entertainment\">That&rsquo;s Entertainment</h2>\n<p>We are 100% cord cutters. We&rsquo;ve never subscribed to cable during an entire marriage. That doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean we&rsquo;ve saved a lot of money because we subscibed to just about all the major streaming services: <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/browse\">Netflix</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Video/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=2858778011\">Amazon Prime Video</a>, <a href=\"https://play.max.com/\">Max</a>, <a href=\"https://tv.apple.com/\">AppleTV+</a>, <a href=\"https://www.hulu.com/hub/home\">Hulu</a> and <a href=\"https://www.disneyplus.com/\">Disney</a>. Of course we have the apps on our iOS devices and have been known to download shows to watch while we travel. Additionally we have digital subscriptions to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/\">The New York Times</a> and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/\">Washington Post</a> for news. This also gives me access to the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/id911422904\">NYT Cooking app</a> and gives her a chance to play <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nyt-games-word-games-sudoku/id307569751\">Wordle and other games</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"finance\">Finance</h2>\n<p>No discussion of married life would be complete without bringing up finances. My wife is a CPA so she handles that side of our house. I get a budget for my app addiction. We were avid Mint users for years but sadly that service is at end of life. After much research, we decided to switch to <a href=\"https://www.monarchmoney.com/\">Monarch Money</a>. We both have the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/id1459319842\">app</a> on our phones. It tracks our balances, our credit cards and our investments.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>It&rsquo;s clear that technology plays a significant role in our daily lives, from work to play. As a couple with a shared passion for all things tech, we&rsquo;ve found various apps and services that have seamlessly integrated into our 21st-century lifestyle. From the OG Evernote to Apple Family Sharing, Anylist, Aboard, Amazon and Alexa, shared passwords, entertainment, and finance, we&rsquo;ve used these tools to enhance our efficiency and organization. We hope that by sharing our use cases, you may find these resources as valuable as we have. Embracing technology has undoubtedly enriched our lives, and we look forward to discovering even more cool solutions in the future. Here&rsquo;s to a tech-savvy and connected future for all!  If you have any tech-savvy tips or tools you&rsquo;d like to share with us, we&rsquo;d love to hear from you.</p>\n",

It even has a [browser extension](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/aboard/epfokbjhopgfjfdaeaonacbahioofmol?hl=en-US) so we can both add things while we work on our PCs.\n\n![A screenshot of our Kindle library](https://cdn.some.pics/amerpie/65abe08cee28b.png)\n## Amazon and Alexa\nAs I mentioned, we use an Amazon Echo, specifically an [Echo Show 15](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BHZX3TYV/?ie=UTF8), in our kitchen. It's the digital message board for our house with a visual representation of our family shopping list, our joint todo list, a collection of family photos and a constantly updated weather report. We use a joint Amazon account, which allows us to also share [Kindle](https://read.amazon.com/kindle-library) e-books and [Audible](https://www.audible.com/) audio books. We've been using those services so heavily and for so long that we have hundreds of each.\n\n## Surviving Passwords\nBefore Apple [implemented shared passwords](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/iphone/iphe6b2b7043/ios) in Mac OS 14 (Sonoma) and iOS 17, we already had a method of securely keping and sharing passwords and other sensitive date with a [LastPass Family Sharing Plan.](https://www.lastpass.com/products/family-password-manager)It's more full-featured than Keychain since it has the capability of storing secure notes and documents as well as passwords. One thing we've done is made sure that we both have access to each other's LastPass vault if we become the lone survivor of our marriage. We've done the same with [Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102631#:~:text=Share%20the%20access%20key%20with,ID%20and%20access%20your%20data.) and [Google](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-give-google-account-to-trusted-person-when-you-die-2018-8). Please make sure you do the same!\n\n![A Screenshot of the TV apps on my iPhone](https://cdn.some.pics/amerpie/65abe2395999e.png)\n## That's Entertainment\nWe are 100% cord cutters. We've never subscribed to cable during an entire marriage. That doesn't necessarily mean we've saved a lot of money because we subscibed to just about all the major streaming services: [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/browse), [Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Video/b?ie=UTF8&node=2858778011), [Max](https://play.max.com/), [AppleTV+](https://tv.apple.com/), [Hulu](https://www.hulu.com/hub/home) and [Disney](https://www.disneyplus.com/). Of course we have the apps on our iOS devices and have been known to download shows to watch while we travel. Additionally we have digital subscriptions to [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) and [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/) for news. This also gives me access to the [NYT Cooking app](https://apps.apple.com/app/id911422904) and gives her a chance to play [Wordle and other games](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nyt-games-word-games-sudoku/id307569751).\n\n## Finance\nNo discussion of married life would be complete without bringing up finances. My wife is a CPA so she handles that side of our house. I get a budget for my app addiction. We were avid Mint users for years but sadly that service is at end of life. After much research, we decided to switch to [Monarch Money](https://www.monarchmoney.com/). We both have the [app](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1459319842) on our phones. It tracks our balances, our credit cards and our investments.\n\n## Conclusion\nIt's clear that technology plays a significant role in our daily lives, from work to play. As a couple with a shared passion for all things tech, we've found various apps and services that have seamlessly integrated into our 21st-century lifestyle. From the OG Evernote to Apple Family Sharing, Anylist, Aboard, Amazon and Alexa, shared passwords, entertainment, and finance, we've used these tools to enhance our efficiency and organization. We hope that by sharing our use cases, you may find these resources as valuable as we have. Embracing technology has undoubtedly enriched our lives, and we look forward to discovering even more cool solutions in the future. Here's to a tech-savvy and connected future for all!  If you have any tech-savvy tips or tools you'd like to share with us, we'd love to hear from you.\n\n",

				"title": "Microsoft Edge Really Doesn't Suck",
				"content_html": "<p><img src=\"https://amerpie.micro.blog/uploads/2024/001-what-is-microsoft-edge-.jpeg\" alt=\"Microsoft Edge Logo\"></p>\n<p>Last year, the small private university where I work purchased new laptops for the staff and I was charged with deploying them, a process that had me visiting over a hundred employee to help them back up and migrate their documents and settings, Including browser bookmarks. One of the first questions I asked each person was &ldquo;What browser do you use?&rdquo; Almost all of them told me Google Chrome. A few holdouts used Firefox and only one or two named Edge&hellip;and they weren&rsquo;t the power users if you know what I mean.</p>\n<p>I came to work at the university after being retired from the public school system for a couple of years. During my career I primarily supported Macs and I&rsquo;d used one myself since the days of OS 9. This was my first extended experience working in a Microsoft centric environment. There are a few Macs on campus but overwhelmingly our users are PC based. When I started, I was assigned a Dell AIO desktop with Windows 10. I intuited that Edge had good integration with Microsoft 365, so I chose to use it despite having been primarily a Safari and Chrome user in the past. I can use any browser I want. My coworkers in the IT department use Brave, Firefox and Chrome but after my initial choice I&rsquo;ve decided to stick with Edge and have in fact made it my default browser on my iPhone and my new M2 MacBook Air.</p>\n<p>Why, you ask? Because despite what the world seems to believe, Edge really doesn&rsquo;t suck. In fact, it&rsquo;s variety of features make it one of my favorite pieces of software to use. Is it perfect? No. Like most Chromium based browsers it&rsquo;s a memory hog. As a heavy user of Apple&rsquo;s Shortcuts app on my phone and Mac, I find that most browser related workflows are written for Safari and don&rsquo;t work as well in Edge. Still, the good overwhelmingly outweighs the bad. Edge has quite a few features that are cutting edge, if not unique.</p>\n<h2 id=\"profiles\">Profiles</h2>\n<p>I have separate profiles for home and work. At work Edge, when signed into Microsoft 365 is managed, meaning I can install no extensions and save no passwords, but I do have ready access to all my documents in OneDrive, my Outlook email accounts our campus Intranet and more. I have a set of work-related bookmarks I use with this profile. I simultaneously open another browser window signed into a different Microsoft account and voila, I then have access to all my extensions, a different set of bookmarks and my bookmark manager of choice, <a href=\"https://www.lastpass.com/\">LastPass</a>, which also holds my credit card info in case I need to buy anything through the browser. I use the same personal profile at home so I can save things I want to reference at work in my extra browser window.</p>\n<h2 id=\"workspaces\">Workspaces</h2>\n<p>Within a profile, users can create collections, browser setups for unique use cases. I have one for general browsing with my go to collection of bookmarks in the bookmark (or favorites as Edge calls them) bar. I have another setup for blogging with a different set of bookmarks available in the bookmarks bar.

				"content_text": "\n![Microsoft Edge Logo](https://amerpie.micro.blog/uploads/2024/001-what-is-microsoft-edge-.jpeg)\n\nLast year, the small private university where I work purchased new laptops for the staff and I was charged with deploying them, a process that had me visiting over a hundred employee to help them back up and migrate their documents and settings, Including browser bookmarks. One of the first questions I asked each person was \"What browser do you use?\" Almost all of them told me Google Chrome. A few holdouts used Firefox and only one or two named Edge...and they weren't the power users if you know what I mean.\n\nI came to work at the university after being retired from the public school system for a couple of years. During my career I primarily supported Macs and I'd used one myself since the days of OS 9. This was my first extended experience working in a Microsoft centric environment. There are a few Macs on campus but overwhelmingly our users are PC based. When I started, I was assigned a Dell AIO desktop with Windows 10. I intuited that Edge had good integration with Microsoft 365, so I chose to use it despite having been primarily a Safari and Chrome user in the past. I can use any browser I want. My coworkers in the IT department use Brave, Firefox and Chrome but after my initial choice I've decided to stick with Edge and have in fact made it my default browser on my iPhone and my new M2 MacBook Air.\n\nWhy, you ask? Because despite what the world seems to believe, Edge really doesn't suck. In fact, it's variety of features make it one of my favorite pieces of software to use. Is it perfect? No. Like most Chromium based browsers it's a memory hog. As a heavy user of Apple's Shortcuts app on my phone and Mac, I find that most browser related workflows are written for Safari and don't work as well in Edge. Still, the good overwhelmingly outweighs the bad. Edge has quite a few features that are cutting edge, if not unique.\n\n## Profiles\n\nI have separate profiles for home and work. At work Edge, when signed into Microsoft 365 is managed, meaning I can install no extensions and save no passwords, but I do have ready access to all my documents in OneDrive, my Outlook email accounts our campus Intranet and more. I have a set of work-related bookmarks I use with this profile. I simultaneously open another browser window signed into a different Microsoft account and voila, I then have access to all my extensions, a different set of bookmarks and my bookmark manager of choice, [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/), which also holds my credit card info in case I need to buy anything through the browser. I use the same personal profile at home so I can save things I want to reference at work in my extra browser window.\n\n## Workspaces\n\nWithin a profile, users can create collections, browser setups for unique use cases. I have one for general browsing with my go to collection of bookmarks in the bookmark (or favorites as Edge calls them) bar. I have another setup for blogging with a different set of bookmarks available in the bookmarks bar. Both workspaces share the same general set of bookmarks from the menu bar or toolbar button, so I don't have to worry about syncing two collections. Tabs can be set to be remembered between sessions, so when I'm ready to work on a blog entry, I have tabs for [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/) [omg.lol](https://home.omg.lol/), and my [Mastodon account](https://social.lol/@amerpie). It's all really handy and allows me to just open up the browser and go to work.\n\n## Extensions\n\nEdge can use the same extensions available to Google Chrome and there's a vast selection to choose from. I don't find that running all the extensions I need slows Edge down appreciably, so I install what I need. Extensions are specific to the profile you are using, but workspaces within the same profile share the same extensions. You can create a different Mac and PC profile is you find yourself using extensions that are platform specific. Here's what I use:\n.\n- [Omnivore](https://omnivore.app/) - It's the best read it later service around these days, featuring a mobile app with read aloud capability, newsletter subscription service, RSS feeds and a browser extension.\n- [Obsidian Web Clipper](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/markdownload-markdown-web-clipper/173) - I primarily use a [bookmarklet](https://gist.github.com/extratone/7a881fff3c9472f607c4730be08b1c87) for saving web content into [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/) on my Mac, but I use a different vault at work on my PC where Drafts isn't available.\n- [Raindrop.io](https://app.raindrop.io/) - I have a subscription and heartily endorse Raindrop.io for it's cross platform support as well as it's [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) and [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/raindrop) integration which really helps me when I'm researching anything\n- [Aboard](https://obsidian.md/) - This is the extension for the app my wife and I use to share links with each other. When I find an app, a TV show, a news story or whatever, I put it into Aboard and she gets a notification and can check it out when she has time. It's free and useful.\n- [Chrome Remote Desktop](https://remotedesktop.google.com/) - This allows me to access my home computer from other locations. It's free, easy to set up and use and reliable. I don't know what people pay for [Screens](https://www.edovia.com/en/screens/) or [TeamViewer](https://www.teamviewer.com/en/) subscriptions.\n- [UBlock Origin](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm)- The best ad blocker on the planet. 31,000,000 downloads can't be wrong.\n- [Toby](https://www.gettoby.com/) - My new tab extension. It makes it easy to save and open windows full of tabs on the go. I use the free version and even though I maintain my [start.me](https://start.me/) page, I stick with Toby for new tabs.\n- [Velja](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/velja/gpipdgcamiclkcomcnogmlfpalggmcmk) - Works in conjunction with the Mac app of the same name to open URLs in other bowsers and apps (e.g., Slack, Teams, Zoom, Freetube etc)\n\n## Collections\n\nOne of the features in Edge I find really useful is available on the desktop and mobile version of the browser. You can create collections of bookmarks on the fly for things you want to investigate later but don't necessarily want to save forever. I have five collections:\n\n- **Shopping** - this is mostly a collection of Amazon pages I can keep separate from my Amazon wish list so my wife can't see what I was thinking of getting her for her birthday\n- **Software** - I'm an unembarrassed software nerd, always looking for the latest cool program to try out. I keep a running collection of pages of programs I want to look at.\n- **Windows** - Most of my leisure browsing happens on my mac, but when I find something that might be useful on my day job, I save it to my Windows collection to investigate at work\n- **TV** - When I come across a review of an upcoming television show, I add it to this collection. Once a week I read all the emails from streaming services and the web pages I've collected and i cultivate the viewing list for my wife and I\n- **Reading List** - I use a read it later app (Omnivore) but sometimes I just add a news article or How-to guide to my reading list collection if it's something I know I'll just read in my browser.\n\n## Other features I like\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, one of the best kept secrets of using a computer in 2024 is the free access to Chat-GPT4 built into [Bing/CoPilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/). There are people out there paying $20 a month to do what they can do for free with CoPilot and it's built right into Edge.
